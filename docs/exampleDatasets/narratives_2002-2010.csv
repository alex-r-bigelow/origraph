4345,10201,"Beginning on January 6, 2002, Ethiopian military forces occupied much of the Puntland region in support of the insurgent Abdullahi Yusuf against the Somali TNC.  During the occupation, the Ethiopian military assaulted the town of Guriceel, in the Galgaduud Region, and confiscated weapons from civilians in the town.  It is likely that similar unreported incidents occurred in other towns as well. On March 3, Ethiopian military forces, supported by armored vehicles and local Somali militants fighting against the Somali TNC, attacked and captured the town of Bulo Hawo in the Gedo region.  This incident was mirrored on May 15, when Ethiopian forces and Somali SRRC militia attacked and occupied the towns of Garbaharey and Bulo Hawo in the Gedo region of Somalia, clashing with Somali military units in the process. This was the highest action taken by both sides during the course of the dispute. Beginning on June 25, Ethiopian forces expanded their occupation by establishing military bases in the Somali regions of Hiraan in central Somalia and Bakool in southcentral Somalia in an effort to stop the use of Somali territory by Ethiopian opposition rebel groups.  On September 19, Ethiopian troops crossed the border with Somalia and abducted 12 village elders from the village of Geri-Jur in the Galgudud region, as well as temporarily closing roads and confiscating radio equipment and weapons from the villagers. In late November, Ethiopian military forces briefly entered Somali territory and seized 16 guns from local Somali pastoralists along the border before returning to Ethiopian territory. In late December, Ethiopia amasses hundreds of troops along its border with the Somali region of Hiiraan for the purposes of securing the border against incursion by Somali military forces and rebels. In March of 2003, Ethiopia, with the aid of U.S. helicopters, increases its vigil of its border with Somalia in an effort to stop the trafficking of contraband and terrorists into the country.  The underlying issue of the MID is one of Ethiopia's struggles with and against various rebel groups operating in Somalia, as it both operated with Somali rebels against the incumbent TNC and against rebels using Somalia as a host to attack Ethiopian territory.  Certainly, information on Ethiopia's occupation and operations in Somalia were periodically sparse; while reports provide information on various operations against villages and Somali military targets, it is unclear for how long Ethiopian troops were continuously stationed in Somali territory.  However, it is clear that multiple, large-scale operations occurred in Somali territory."
4346,10202,"After closing the border and sending troops to the border for unstated reasons, Ethiopian military forces occupied a secondary school along the Kenyan-Somali border.  Kenya sent police forces to the school and, while no hostilities took place, the Ethiopian forces eventually relinquished control of the school and returned to Ethiopia.  It remains unclear why the occupation of the Kenyan school occurred."
4347,10203,"In January 2002, Rwandan military units, backed by DRC rebels from Goma, attacked the town of Muyenyi in the Kindu province as a reprisal for fighting between Rwandan forces and Mayi Mayi rebels earlier in the year.  This would begin a long string of attacks by Rwandan military forces on towns in the DRC, mostly in the Kivu region, for various reasons, but mostly under the umbrella of locating anti-government Rwandan rebels working from DRC. In March 2002, Rwandan military forces entered and attacked the village of Moliro in eastern DRC.  DRC pulled out of peace talks with Rwanda because of the occupation. In early April 2002, Rwanda launched a military offensive, utilizing between 4,000 and 5,000 troops, in the South Kivu Province of DRC. In June 2002, Rwanda sends hundreds of troops to occupy and fight ethnic Tutsi RCD rebels in the Sud-Kivu region of the DRC. Beginning in September 2002, the periodic attacks on DRC territory became coupled with a lasting military occupation of much of the Kivu region by Rwandan military forces following the removal of Ugandan and Zimbabwean forces from the area as part of a regional truce.  Although not stated clearly, this Rwandan occupation eventually ended.  However, in October of 2002, DRC-backed militia units occupied the town of Bugarama near the Rwandan border.  This prompted the Rwandan military to send thousands of troops and armored units back into DRC territory to reoccupy the town. The conflict seemingly lay dormant for the rest of 2002, but in March 2003 Rwandan accused Uganda of forming alliances with “genocidal” rebel groups in the DRC with the intent of attacking Rwanda.  To that end, they threatened to send troops back into the DRC and occupy territory there with the intention of fighting such alliances, and amassed troops along the border with the DRC.  This threat ultimately resulted in a new occupation of DRC territory, specifically the Kivu region, by Rwandan military units.  Rwanda sent thousands of troops back to DRC and occupied much of eastern DRC, attacking and occupying the towns of Bingi, Butembo, Beni, Lubero, and Kanyabayonga.  The DRC government protested the occupation of DRC territory by Rwandan military units."
4348,10204,"The military of Sierra Leone sent additional military units to its border with Liberia to prevent what it believed was Liberian support of militants in Sierra Leone and incursions by Liberian military units into Sierra Leone. Additionally, Sierra Leone captured about 50 Liberian soldiers in June 2002 that had entered Sierra Leone in an effort to raid villages close to the border for food and supplies."
4349,10205,"The Sudanese military in March 2002 mobilized additional troops at its border with Eritrea to prevent any incursion into the state by SPLA rebels acting from bases in Eritrea.  This was followed in April 2002 when Sudan places its border forces and general populace on alert after reports of SPLA rebels infiltrating the country from Eritrea. In October 2002, the dispute escalated, as the Sudanese government accused the Eritrean military of fighting alongside and supporting the SPLA during a military offensive beginning on October 5, leading to clashes between the two countries.  On October 13, Sudan took several Eritrean soldiers prisoner after a clash. Sudanese and Eritrean military forces clashed again on October 18, near the countries’ shared border after Eritrean soldiers entered Sudanese territory. The news report states that the Eritrean soldiers were repelled by Sudanese forces.  The last available incident was when, on October 21, the Sudanese internal security forces arrested several Eritreans, including two Eritrean diplomats, in Khartoum."
4351,10207,"After extending operations against the Casamance rebels to the border with Gambia, Senegal deployed additional military forces along the Gambian border to prevent Casamance rebels entering Senegal from bases in Gambia."
4353,10209,Tanzania tightens security along its border with Burundi after Burundi accused the country of backing Burundian rebels and allowing them to operate from Tanzania.
4352,10208,"On July 11, 2002, Moroccan military forces occupied the North African island of Ceuta, which is controlled by Spain, but nominally claimed by Morocco, under the auspices of combating drug trafficking in the region.  This prompted Spain, on July 16, to send a naval warship to the waters off of the island’s coast as a show of dominance over the island. Additionally, Spain sent additional naval and marine forces to the island of Ceuta in August 2002.  The marine forces expelled Moroccan troops stationed on the island, then left.  Both sides agreed not to reoccupy the island, and agreed to talks over the fate of the island in September."
4354,10210,"During the last week of August, 2002, the United Kingdom stated that it may militarily intervene in Zimbabwe to protect the interests of white land-owning farmers during a contested Zimbabwean land reform program.  Zimbabwe responded by stating that any intervention in Zimbabwe would be met with military reciprocation.  No such intervention ever occurred."
4355,10211,"On September 2, 2002, Ethiopian soldiers crossed over the border with Eritrea in the Shambeko sub-zone and stole 170 cattle, which was protested by the Eritrean government."

4358,10214,"Liberia increases its border security to prevent rebels from the Ivory Coast from entering the country and to prevent Liberians from entering the Ivory Coast to participate in the civil war there. In January 2003, a clash occurred near the Ivorian town of Toulepleu between the Ivorian military and a combination of Ivorian rebels supported by soldiers from the Liberian army."
4350,10206,"On June 30, 2002, Ugandan soldiers crossed into neighboring Kenya and looted several head of cattle.  Later, on July 1, a group of Ugandan soldiers crossed the border into the Kenyan town of Amaguriat.  While in the town, the soldiers entered into a firefight with local Kenyan police, in which one of the Ugandan soldiers was killed before they retreated."
4356,10212,"Following the incidents of MID 10203, Rwanda engaged in a series of occupations of DRC territory in violation of the July 31, 2002 peace agreement.  These occupations occurred due to what Rwanda claimed were the formation of alliances between Ugandan military forces and anti- Rwandan rebels based in DRC.  It remains largely unclear for how long the occupations of DRC territory occurred."
4360,10301,"Sudan impounded a Russian helicopter and its 13 member crew on July 24, 2003 as it flew over Sudanese territory en route to a UN mission in the DRC. The crew and helicopter was released on July 29, 2003."
4361,10302,Algerian planes briefly violated Malian airspace before returning to Algeria.
4362,10303,"Ethiopian and Eritrean military forces clashed near the Eritrean village of Fawlina, in the demilitarized zone between the two countries.  It is unclear why the clash erupted. On November 27, 2003, Eritrea began amassing thousands of troops along its border with Ethiopia, near the demilitarized zone between the two countries."
4363,10304,"On November 1, 2003, 40 Ethiopian soldiers crossed the border with Kenya and attacked the village of Anan.  The reason for the attack is unknown."
4364,10305,Malian military forces went on heightened alert and began a security sweep of the region bordering Mauritania after the government received reports of Islamic rebels crossing the border into Mali from Mauritania.
4365,10401,"Rwanda deployed additional troops to its border with Burundi to prevent Interahamwe rebels, based mostly in DRC and with whom Rwanda has clashed previously (see MID 10203 and 10212), from entering and attacking Rwanda through Burundi’s largely lawless Cibitoke province."
4366,10402,"On April 24, 2004, Rwanda escalated action by invading the DRC Kivu region with the additional military forces and attacking the DRC towns of Masisi and Rutshuru while looking for Interahamwe rebels and occupying the territory. During the course of this occupation, Rwanda also continued to fortify its border with the DRC with thousands of additional troops. In August 2004, the fighting in DRC spilled over into neighboring Burundi, when Hutu extremist rebels, reportedly with the aid of Congolese military units, attacked a Tutsi refugee camp, killing 160 people.  In response, both Rwanda and Burundi threatened to send troops into DRC territory to attack rebel bases in eastern Congo.  At about the same time, the Burundian government accused soldiers from the DRC of firing their automatic weapons across the border at the Burundian military checkpoint at Gatumba. The dispute seemed mostly dormant until the end of November 2004, when Rwanda sent troops into DRC to attack and occupy the rebel-held villages of Goma, Beni, and Ikobo in eastern Congo.  This prompted the DRC government to place its military forces on heightened alert for possible clashes with Rwandan military units."
4367,10403,"On April 29, 2004, Janjaweed militia forces from Sudan crossed into Chad and attacked a village, raiding cattle.  As they were retreating to Sudanese territory, Chadian military forces caught them and engaged in a firefight with the group.  At that time, Sudanese military forces crossed over into Chadian territory and entered into the clash, giving the Janjaweed fighters time to retreat into Sudanese territory. Following several more incursions into Chadian territory by Janjaweed fighters from Sudan, France deployed 200 soldiers already stationed in Chad to the border between the two countries to help protect the territorial integrity of Chad."
4368,10404,"Following the occupation of the DRC town of Bukavu by rebels, Zambia prepared to accept refugees from war-torn eastern DRC.  At the same time, the Zambian military was placed on heightened alert to monitor border towns against insurgents and a spillover of the conflict between the belligerents of MID 10402."
4369,10405,"In July 2004, 8 Kenyans were killed by Ethiopian militiamen who had crossed over to raid Kenyan territory.  In response, Kenya increased their border security to discourage further attacks from Ethiopian territory.  In January 2005, another attack took place on Kenyan territory, as 20 armed Ethiopian soldiers crossed the border and attacked the village of Moyale in northern Kenya, killing a police officer.  Again, in March 2005, several “armed raiders” crossed into Kenyan territory, killing a police officer and wounding four others.  This event prompted the Kenyan military to again increase its border security."
4371,10407,"On November 6, 2004, Ivory Coast war planes bombed French military units at an airport in Ivory Coast.  The French military units were in Ivory Coast acting as peacekeepers between Ivorian government and rebel factions. Following the attack, Ivorian ground units exchanged fire with French units before retreating.  In response to the two attacks, the French forces on the ground destroyed 2 Ivorian fighter jets at the airport, and France sent three fighter jets to the Gabonese capital Libreville in case of further attacks."

4373,10501,"Following the attack on a Kenyan border village by militiamen from Somalia, Kenya deployed an additional army unit to the border between the two countries.  Additionally, Kenya again fortified its border with Somalia in March 2005 with additional armored vehicles and helicopters to prevent the spread of Somali tribal conflict into Kenya."
4375,10503,"During much of 2005, both Ethiopia and Eritrea have consistently increased their military presence along the disputed border separating the two countries."
4376,10504,"Although the underlying reasons are unclear, hundreds of Ethiopian troops are sent to the Ethiopian-Somalia border near the towns of Gaalkacyo and Goldogob.  It is possible that the underlying issue is the continuing presence of anti-Ethiopian rebels in the region (see MID 10201)."
4377,10505,"After receiving complaints from residents of the Western DRC town of Luiza that Angolan helicopters have been flying over DRC airspace and that Angolan boats are active in DRC territorial waters along the Kasai river, the DRC threatens to send military units to the region to discourage such incursions."

4382,10510,"Following the events of MID 10407, France declared that any provocations against its forces in CDI by Ivorian forces would be met with force.  A short time later, France also deployed nine additional tanks to the country as part of its peace-keeping operation."
4384,10512,"In November 2004, Sudan accused Chad of conducting military flights over Sudanese border territory.  In December 2004, Chadian military units pursued Sudanese rebels into Sudanese territory following a raid on a Chadian village by the rebels.  Chad also declared that it would continue a policy of pursuing Sudanese rebels on Sudanese territory to protect its villages.  In January 2006, the Sudanese government iterated its claim that Chadian military planes were regularly flying over Sudanese territory. Finally, in February 2006, a Sudanese village came under artillery fire from Chadian territory.  This artillery shelling was followed by a ground assault on the village by Chadian troops.  The Chadian forces clashed with Sudanese military units and were eventually repelled from Sudanese territory."
4383,10511,"In a continuation of the events of MID 10504, both Ethiopia and Eritrea continue to send additional troops to the demilitarized zone between the respective countries."
4374,10502,"In January 2005, an attack took place on Kenyan territory, as 20 armed Ethiopian soldiers crossed the border and attacked the village of Moyale in northern Kenya, killing a police officer.  A few months later, Kenya deployed additional troops to the Kenya-Ethiopia border to prevent such cross-border attacks."
4381,10509,Uganda threatened to deploy troops into eastern DRC to combat rebels there if the DRC did not do more to disarm the rebels based in eastern DRC.
4385,10601,"On April 24, 2006, about 60 Ethiopian soldiers crossed over the border into neighboring Kenya and attacked the border village of Somare, which was believed to be harboring OLF rebels.  Reports claim that the soldiers abducted two individuals.  A few days later, Ethiopian soldiers crossed the border in another attempt to attack the village of Somare.  However, the soldiers were intercepted and ambushed by a detachment of Kenyan soldiers.  The two groups of soldiers clashed and, while no Kenyan soldiers were killed, reports state that “several” Ethiopian soldiers were killed, although no number was ever specified."
4386,10602,"On April 28, 2006, Ugandan soldiers in machine-gun mounted trucks crossed over into neighboring DRC in pursuit of LRA rebels.  The Ugandan troops came across a detachment of DRC soldiers, and a firefight ensued, resulting in the death of one Ugandan soldier before the Ugandan troops retreated to Ugandan territory."
4387,10603,"In some ways, this MID is a mirror to the previous MID 10201, with many of the same underlying issues between Ethiopia, Somali-based rebels, and the Somali TNC.  This MID contains several incidents of Ethiopian incursions into Somali territory, but without any incidents of violence or fighting with Somali troops or rebels.  On June 18, 2006, Ethiopian forces in several machine-gun mounted trucks crossed into the Gedo region for about 5 hours while simultaneously moving additional troops to the border to prevent incursions from Somalia.  From June 28 to July 4 of 2006, Ethiopian forces occupied the Somali town of Beled Xaawo with about 200 troops. Later, beginning on July 21, Ethiopia moved several hundred troops, supported by about 140 tanks, to south-central Somalia.  It is unclear where the troops were moved to.  However, it is likely that the troops were utilized later in the occupation of the town of Bur Haqaba from Somali rebels."
4388,10604,"On August 17, 2006, Rwandan soldiers apparently crossed over the Rwanda-Burundi border into the Kayanza province before returning to Rwanda.  It is unclear why the violation occurred, but no damage to Burundian territory was reported."

4390,10606,"On October 18, 2006, Chad reportedly struck several Sudanese military positions in Darfur with aerial bombings in support of SPLA rebels operating in the region.  In response, Sudan threatened that, if the bombings did not stop, Sudan would counter-attack against Chadian villages. This threat was carried out in March 2007, when Sudan bombed villages in the Chadian regions of Gregni and Kariari. In early April 2007, the final incident of the MID occurred when Chad crossed the border with Sudan in pursuit of Chadian National Concord rebels.  During the pursuit, the Chadian military forces clashed with Sudanese military forces near the town of For Baranga, which ultimately resulted in the Chadian forces returning to Chadian territory."
4391,10607,"Beginning in early November 2006, Kenya deployed additional troops and armored vehicles to the border it shares with the Gedo region of Somalia, most likely as a means of preventing a spillover of civil conflict raging in Somalia between the TNC, Ethiopian forces, and Somali rebels."
4392,10701,"The underlying issue of this MID is the ongoing contestation of the border between Uganda and the DRC in and around Lake Albert.  On July 28, 2007 4 Ugandan soldiers were detained by DRC troops while conducting a border survey.  The soldiers were detained until August 6.  During this period, Uganda deployed additional troops to its border with DRC. On September 25, a clash occurred between Ugandan and DRC troops on Lake Albert when a Ugandan military boat came into contact with a DRC boat, onboard of which were two DRC soldiers.  The clash killed one of the DRC soldiers. In December of 2007 two Congolese soldiers were shot and killed on Ugandan territory by Ugandan soldiers for resisting arrest for the suspected rape of Ugandan women."
4393,10702,"On September 9, 2007, six Congolese soldiers were captured and detained by Burundian military forces after attacking Burundian fishermen on Lake Tanganyika.  It is unclear when, or if, the Congolese soldiers were released."
4394,10703,Ethiopian and Eritrean troops stationed along their disputed border briefly exchanged gunfire across the border (see MID 10605 and previous).
4395,10704,"In the final days of 2007, Chad launched an attack, using both ground troops and war planes, against anti-Chadian rebel bases near the Sudanese towns of Rijlal-Haraziya and Karmula in the Darfur region.  Another aerial attack against rebel bases in the Darfur region occurred on January 7, 2008, and again against a rebel base near Ade, Sudan on January 28, 2008. In early April 2008, a Chadian military helicopter launched rockets at a Sudanese military installation in Um Tamjoob, but it is unknown why Chad suddenly attacked a Sudanese military position.  In May 2008 the conflict escalated as Chadian and Sudanese military forces clashed in the Sudanese Kashkash region, with the Sudanese forces ultimately repelling the Chadian attackers. On June 17, Sudanese military forces, including both troops and helicopters, attacked a Chadian military outpost in the Chadian region of Ade.  Finally, on July 13, several Sudanese war planes flew over the Chadian town of Bahay, but did not attack any military or civilian positions."

4398,10803,"On April 28, 2008, Eritrean forces crossed the border into Djibouti and began building defensive positions, most notably troop trenches on both sides of the border.  It is unclear for how long the Eritrean troops remained in the territory of Djibouti.  Eritrean troops pursued Eritrean military deserters into Djiboutan territory where they encountered and fired upon Djiboutan military units.  The Djiboutans responded with military force.  Two Djiboutan soldiers were killed in the clash."
4399,10804,"On May 9, 2008, Sudanese military forces crossed into the Ethiopian town of Tach Armacheho and proceeded to set fire to the town and steal farm goods. However, the Ethiopian villagers fought back, and took 8 Sudanese soldiers as prisoners. On July 8, Ethiopian troops crossed 10 miles into Sudan and attacked a police camp, killing 1 Sudanese police officer."
4400,10805,"On November 11, 2008, Kenya began amassing soldiers and aircraft along its border with Somalia’s Gedo region, which is the site of the ongoing Ethiopian military occupation of Somali territory and clashes between Ethiopian forces and Somali rebels."
4401,10806,"On December 5, 2008, Ethiopian soldiers fired mortars into a neighborhood of Mogadishu, killing 15 civilians.  Later, in February 2009, Ethiopian troops moved into and occupied a portion of the Bakool region of Somalia and, in May 2009, a portion of the Hiraan region.  In December 2009, hundreds of Ethiopian troops, along with armored vehicles, occupied a section of the Galguduud region of central Somalia.  In March 2010, Ethiopian troops again occupied a portion of central Somalia, using their position as a forward station for searching the area for Islamist rebels."
4402,10901,"On February 27, 2009, Angolan soldiers entered the towns of Sava Ina and Kuzi and began setting fire to homes and state offices.  The soldiers also chased out all of the villagers from the towns and occupied the villages for an unknown amount of time."

Darfur responded to the attack with a statement that such attacks on Sudanese territory would not go unanswered.  Then, on May 17, Chad deployed ground troops to the Darfur region to attack Chadian rebel bases before returning to Chad.  In response to this attack, Sudan stated that its military would attack any Chadian troops attempting to cross the border into Sudan. On July 16, two Chadian bombers carried out an aerial attack against believed rebel bases in the Um Dakhn locality of western Darfur."
4404,10903,In June and September of 2009 Kenya deployed additional troops to its common border with Somalia as a measure against attacks by the Al- Shabab Islamist rebel group.
4405,11001,"On January 3, 2010, Ethiopian troops attacked Eritrean troops in the Zalambesa area of the two countries’ disputed border (see MID 10703 for reference).  However, the Eritrean soldiers fought back the advance of Ethiopian troops, killing 10 Ethiopian troops in the process."

Later, on August 29, Yemen captured 9 Eritrean soldiers posing as fishermen in the Yemeni port of al-Hoedieda.  The fate of the Yemeni soldiers/fishermen is unclear."
4408,11004,"On August 29, 2010, “hundreds” of Ugandan soldiers crossed into Kenya’s Amkuriat region, stealing cattle and, in the process, killing three Kenyan cattle herders."
4414,20208,"This dispute stems from an underlying territorial issue between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the Nagorno-Karabakh region.  While Nagorno-Karabakh is internationally recognized as Azerbaijani territory, it is primarily populated by ethnic Armenians.  In 1988, Nagorno-Karabakh had attempted to re-unify with Armenia, and subsequently declared independence from Azerbaijan, resulting in civil conflict.  Armenia eventually intervened in the conflict, which ended in a 1994 ceasefire.  Since that time, Nagorno-Karabakh and its surrounding territories have been jointly controlled by the defense forces of the Nagorno-Karabakh republic and the Armenian military.  Since then each side has engaged in frequent border violations, seizures, and clashes, which comprise the majority of incidents in this militarized dispute.  A difficulty encountered when coding these issues was that news reports seldom make any distinction between Armenian military forces, and the Nagorno-Karabakh Defense Force, which is ethnically Armenian and contains a substantial number of Armenian citizens.  Given this issue and the high degree of coordination between Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh forces, no differentiation could be made between each group.  Thus, all actions taken between these groups and Azeri forces were coded as interstate incidents."
4413,20207,"On 08/06/2002 a Croatian coast guard vessel escorts Slovenian fishing vessels, accompanied by a Slovenian police boat, out of what Croatia claims was its territorial waters.  Slovenia protested the incident and claims that the Croatian vessel was actually in Slovenian waters.  In the time preceding the incident, each side had claimed its territorial waters had been frequently violated by foreign fishing vessels.The two sides came to an agreement on the demarcation of maritime borders in July 2001, but the settlement was not ratified by Croatian parliament.  On 8/23/2002, the Croatian foreign minister agreed to meet with his/her Slovene counterpart to reduce the tension over maritime borders."
4411,20205,"On 5/23/2002, the Russian Federal Border Guard Service deployed reserves to the border with Georgia and Azerbaijan. The purpose of the deployment was to defend against Chechen rebel attempts to enter Russia from Georgia or Azerbaijan."
4409,20203,An Iranian naval vessel entered Azeri waters on 2/22/2002. An Azeri border patrol boat then escorted the Iranian vessel out of Azeri waters.  The Iranian ship then returned to the area with additional naval vessels.
4412,20206,"Six Macedonian soldiers crossed the border between Macedonia and Albania at noon on 7/21/2012. The Macedonian troops crossed 300 meters into Albania and fired on 6 residents in a local village. Albanian civilians were wounded by Macedonian fire. Albania demanded Macedonia join a bilateral verification commission to evaluate the incident, which the latter agreed to."
4410,20204,"Turkish fighter jets harassed Greek jets returning from joint military operations in Cyprus.  The day prior, Turkish jets were accused of violating Cypriot air space.  The incidents are a manifestation of a long-standing dispute between Greece and Turkey over the status of Cyprus."
4320,20201,This is a territorial issue as it follows the pattern of prior disputes where Turkey considers Greek airspace to extend only 6 miles into the Aegean rather than the internationally recognized 12 miles. Each state also holds competing claims over islands within the maritime region. The underlying issue has resulted in several shows of force resulting from airspace violations by each side over the disputed waters and islands.
4415,20209,"On 11/08/2002, two Turkish fighter jets harass Greek civilian aircrafts in the air corridor connecting Cyprus to Greece.  The Greek government protested the incident, which came preceding a peace plan on Cyprus that had been submitted to the UN.  Given the location and timing of this dispute relative to the issuance of the peace plan, this action was coded as being part of the dispute over Cyprus and not the dispute over competing maritime claims in the Aegean."
4242,20202,"Russian forces repeatedly violate Georgian airspace and attack Georgian territory amid operations undertaken to expel Chechen rebels from the Pankisi Gorge.  Georgia protests these actions and frequently responds by fortifying its border. During the time of this dispute, the two states also become engaged in multiple disputes over the separatist regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia."
4417,20302,Russia protested to Denmark over a Danish naval vessel that Russia accused of performing dangerous actions against a Russian naval vessel holding exercises in the Baltic Sea.
4418,20303,The Azeri military went on alert on 5/27/2003 after Iranian planes violated Azeri airspace.
4419,20304,"A few days before 7/24/2003, Moldovan border guards captured at gunpoint a Ukrainian hydro-engineering facility. The facility is located in the middle of the Dniester River on the Moldova-Ukraine border. Moldova and Ukraine lack a border demarcation agreement. Moldova claimed that the facility was in its territory. It insisted that any demarcation be along the Dniester River, an arrangement that again would place the facility in Moldovan territory."
4416,20301,"Georgia protests the Russian deployment of additional troops and equipment to the Tskhinval area (South Ossetia). Georgia claims these actions run counter to the spirit of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty. The two have an outstanding disagreement over the separatist South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions, and are simultaneously engaged in a dispute over Russian attempts to dislodge Chechen rebels from the Pankisi Gorge."
4420,20305,"Russian peacekeeping forces deployed troops and armored equipment in villages outside their jurisdiction.  Georgian officials protested the incident.

4422,20402,"On 4/2/2004, a vehicle transporting Russian officials is fired upon by Georgian forces; there is no evidence of return fire.  On 7/6 of the same year, Georgia detains trucks and equipment of Russian peacekeeping forces, which Russian officials then protest.  A month later, a Russian military jet violates Georgian airspace near South Ossetia. This violation appears to be linked with the South Ossetia/Abkhazia issue incompatibility between the two states and not their simultaneous dispute over Chechen encampments in the Pankisi Gorge."
4425,20502,"On May 23, 2005, a marine unit deployed from the Russian Black Sea Fleet attempted to land troops in Ukrainian territory near Feodosiya, Crimea.

Later, in June of 2005, several Kyrgyz soldiers clashed with Tajik residents, with the ultimate outcome being that the soldiers were taken captive by the Tajik residents in their village.  The fate of the soldiers is unknown."

4433,20603,"This MID is comprised of multiple incidents wherein Tajik border guards fire upon Uzbek civilians or territory.  In one case, an Uzbek border guard had violated the Tajik border.  Incidents such as these have occurred with relative frequency, in part because the border between the two is mined and not fully delimited."
4432,20602,"On two separate occasions, Kyrgyz border guards fired upon Uzbeks accused of entering Kyrgyz territory."
4436,20702,"Russia and Georgia engage in several militarized incidents over the South Ossetia/Abkhazia issue, culminating in the 2008 Russia-Georgia War.  The war resulted from a Georgian attempt to retake South Ossetia.  Russia launched a counter-offensive in both South Ossetia and Abkhazia, ultimately driving Georgian forces from each region.  The conflict did not produce one- thousand battlefield deaths, and it is, therefore, not coded as a war.  While the bulk of hostilities were short-lived, the two states continued to engage in militarized incidents through 2010, typically over Russian land-holdings in the region following the war.  While Russia attained a clear military victory during the 2008 war, the underlying issue over the rule of South Ossetia and Abkhazia remains unresolved, and the dispute is thus coded as ending in a stalemate."

4483,30901,"The impetus of this particular MID was the joint US-ROK military maneuvers in 2009, which North Korean strongly protested.  However, the larger underlying issues remain the demarcation of the Northern Limit Line in the Yellow Sea and continuing tension around the DMZ between PRK and ROK (see MID 30201 and 30802).The majority of incidents involve shows of force by North and South Korea, mostly via North Korean warships crossing over the NLL.

The MID reached a height when North Korean forces shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong, killing several soldiers and resulting in an artillery clash between the two sides. Ultimately, the hostilities between the countries subsided to their normal level of intensity."

Venezuela denied an accusation by Colombia that Venezuelan military planes dropped bombs on Colombian territory in 3/2003 during a battle between left-wing rebels and right-wing paramilitaries. It also denied tolerating Colombian left-wing rebels on its territory or otherwise supporting them. The presidents of Colombia and Venezuela planned to discuss the dispute in a meeting in Venezuela on 4/23/2003, but not formal end to interstate hostilities was ever announced."

Colombia stated that its military counter-attacked FARC mortar shelling from inside Ecuador, but denied that the military entered Colombian airspace. Ecuador claimed the incident was the fourth airspace violation by Colombia in the preceding five months. FARC regularly attack Colombian military targets near the border with Ecuador, and Colombia accuses FARC of staging attacks from inside Ecuador."
4500,40602,"About 70 Venezuelan soldiers and a helicopter entered into Colombian territory and fired on a settlement there.  It is unclear why the attack occurred, but, given the history of hostilities between Venezuela and Colombia over rebels near the countries' shared border, it is possible that the attack occurred on a suspected rebel settlement."

4504,40901,"Similar to previous MIDs involving Ecuador and Colombia, the underlying issue between the two countries remains to be military tensions over actions against rebels operating in the two countries.  On 3/7/2009 and 3/18/2009, Ecuador deployed troops to fortify its border with Colombia, officially in response to the infiltration of Colombian paramilitaries, particularly the right- wing AUC, into Ecuador.  On 8/12/2009, Ecuador again deployed troops to its border with Colombia and demanded that Colombia permanently patrol its side of the border as a condition of resuming diplomatic relations with Colombia, which Ecuador terminated after Colombia attacked FARC rebels inside Ecuador in 3/2008."
4505,40902,"Again, the underlying issue between Colombia and Venezuela is the ongoing military hostilities resulting from actions against rebels operating between the two countries.  On 8/9/2009, Colombia accused Venezuelan troops of an incursion into Venezuela through the Orinoco River to hunt down FARC rebels.  In response to an increasing frequency of incursions into Venezuelan territory by Colombian forces, Venezuela deployed additional troops to secure its border with Colombia.  This additional deployment resulted in Colombia placing its military on “maximum alert.”"

Nicaragua then claimed sovereignty over a small portion of the island, with its troops replacing a Costa Rican flag there with a Nicaraguan flag.  The dispute was brought to both the Organization of American States and the International Court of Justice.  The latter ruled that each state is to refrain from sending any military or civilians personnel to the disputed area (save for Costa Rican environmental monitors), and to refrain from taking any action that may extend the existing dispute."

4273,50202,"Over the course of 2002, US and UK planes bombed various Iraqi defense systems placed either in or near the US-imposed no-fly zones.  During this time Iraq deployed ground forces to its border towns in a preemptive move against future US aggression.  Beginning in March 2003, the US began deploying additional land, naval, and air forces to the the Middle East in a clear show of force and build-up to a future invasion of Iraq. In March 2003, just prior to the US-led invasion, several Middle Eastern countries deployed small numbers of troops to Kuwait in a symbolic show of defense for the neighbor of Iraq, which had been the historical target of Iraqi aggression. Later in March 2003, a US-led coalition, seeking to oust the regime of Saddam Hussein and dismantle alleged Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, invaded Iraq and engaged in major combat operations, ultimately resulting in war, against the country that lasted until May 1, 2003."

4517,50307,"Israel and Syria experienced tensions due to Syria’s support for Hezbollah and various other rebel groups operating against Israel (MID 50201). In one incident, Israeli planes buzzed the palace of Syrian president Bashar al- Assad, perhaps as a show of potential attack capabilities against the Syrian capital. In another, Israel bombed a Palestinian militant training in Syria camp after a suicide attack in Israel. Israel also staged military exercises on the border with Syria in a clear show of force against the Syrian government and their policies."
4512,50302,"During the USA-IRQ war of 2003 (MID 50202), there was a concurrent MID between USA, UKG, and IRN.  The MID began on 3/22 when two USA missiles landed in Iranian territory and US planes violated Iranian airspace while conducting combat operations.  This was met with the Iranian response that it would use military force to repel any further incursions or transgressions against the state.  Later, on June 1, Iranian authorities detained four US soldiers and 2 boats overnight.  About a month later, US forces detained two Iranian reporters due to suspicious activity, which was protested by Iran.  It is unclear when or if the reporters were released."

4523,50406,"Iran moved four battalions of troops to its border with Iraq in the event of a US pullout from Iraq (MID 50202), which would leave a security vacuum in the region.  It is not immediately clear if the battalions were deployed to seal the border defensively, or if they will be used in an offensive capacity to move into Iraq following a US pullout. In August 2004, Iraq deployed additional forces to its border with Iran to prevent incursions into the country and smuggling. On January 5, 2005, Iraq seized two Iranian border guards on the two states’ shared border.  After an Iranian protest of the incident, Iraq released the two Iranian troops."

4524,50407,"The underlying issue of this MID is the increasing hostilities between the US and Iran over the Iranian nuclear program.  In August 2004, US warplanes violated Iranian airspace, apparently to test the sensitivity of Iran’s anti- aircraft defense system.  In November, both a US cruiser and US warplanes simultaneously violated Iranian territorial waters and airspace briefly. In January 2005, US warplanes violated Iranian airspace near Afghanistan, apparently spying on potential Iranian nuclear sites.  This prompted the Iranian military to threaten force to repel all future incursions into Iranian territory."

After taking fire from Iranian border troops, the helicopters returned to Turkey.  Later, on September 29, Turkish troops were fired upon by Iranian border units across the border while searching the border area for PKK terrorists."
4527,50501,"This MID is largely comprised of border skirmishes between Syrian troops and US/Iraqi border forces, and various border violations and shows of force by US forces hunting Iraqi terrorists in Syria. In April, 2005, US and Iraqi forces clashed with Syrian border troops who were apparently attempting to provide covering fire for terrorists crossing the border into Iraq.  Following this incident, the US stepped up its operations in Syrian territory, which resulted in both sides massing troops at the Syrian-Iraqi border to stop crossings from either side.  In July 2005, US and Iraqi forces again clashed with Syrian border troops briefly across the border, possibly mistaking the Syrian troops for terrorists."
4528,50502,"Turkey amassed roughly 10,000 troops along its border with the Kurdistan region of northern Iraq.  The troops were placed in the region in preparation of a future operation into northern Iraq to engage Kurdish militants."

4533,50603,"Despite agreeing to a cease-fire in 2006 (MID 50205), violent incidents continued between Israel, Hezbollah, and Lebanese forces in southern Lebanon.  Israeli forces periodically raided Hezbollah strongholds in southern Lebanon, as well as conducted aerial bombings of both southern Lebanon and areas around Beirut.  The Lebanese military became more active, however, in this MID than in the previous MID between the two countries, directly engaging Israeli jets and troops with their own military forces, resulting in some clashes between the two sides."

4535,50701,"This MID is largely comprised of a continuation of the underlying issue between the US and Iran over Iran’s proposed nuclear program.  On January 11, US forces raided the Iranian consulate in Iraq, seizing five of its staff and confiscating documents.  It is unknown when or if the Iranian officials were released. Later, in March 2007, the US conducted combined troop, naval, and aerial operations in the Persian Gulf as a show of force against Iranian military operations in the area.

4552,70202,"The Afghanistan-Pakistan border was a source of tension for Pakistani forces and Afghan-American forces.  In several instances, the Afghan military deployed additional troops to the Afghanistan-Pakistan border to secure the frontier against incursions by rebels from Pakistan.  These border troops periodically exchanged small-arms fire with Pakistani troops, but it appears the localized conflicts were simple exchanges of hostilities and not part of larger offensives.
