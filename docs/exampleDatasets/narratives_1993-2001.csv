MID Number,Story
3551,"In response to Yugoslav involvement in Bosnian civil war, Western countries first showed force and then began a blockade against Yugoslavia. On 7/16/1992 there was a show of force by USA, UK, France, Germany, Greece, Turkey, Spain and Italy. The blockaded against Yugoslavia commences on 11/22/1992 with Belgium joining the states mentioned above. Netherlands joins the MID due to its assistance to the US and France by enforcing a No-Fly zone over Yugoslavia on 4/12/1339. End date is the end date of the Blockade"
3555,"This MID is the fighting between Yugoslavia and Croatia in Bosnia at the Bosnian and Croatian border. Eventually, the tensions and fighting eased as both turned their attention to Bosnia."
3556,The battle between Bosnia and Croatia (who had been allies) began with a dispute over a gas station.
3557,"This MID occurred in Bosnia as Yugoslav and Bosnian forces fought for control of Bosnian territory. Eventually, Yugoslavia bowed to international pressure and withdrew most of its troops from Bosnia. As that happened the bulk of the fighting turned to the militias, i.e. the Bosnian Serbs versus Bosnia. Since the Bosnian Serbs are not state actors their fights with Bosnia do not enter into this MID."
4001,"Twenty-two out of the twenty-five incidents in this dispute involve border area interactions between Thai and Cambodian troops. Cambodian troops engage Khmer Rouge guerillas on the border and shells land in Thailand, prompting return shelling by Thai forces. The last three incidents in this dispute involve fishing and naval vessels moving across territorial water boundaries, leading to clashes and a seizure."
4002,"This dispute involves a basic conflict between Myanmar (Burma) and Thailand over the use of Burmese/Thai border territory by Karen rebel forces operating against the Burmese government. In border fights with the Karen, Burmese government shelling often spills over into Thailand, and Burmese forces pursue Karen guerillas into Thai territory prompting a Thai military response. The issue of which side initiated the incidents is ambiguous in many of these cases. The areas of operation include the Karen base of Kawmoora in Burma, opposite the Thai village of Mae Sot, 240 miles north of Bangkok, and the Tak province, the Song Yang district of Thailand."
4003,"A peace agreement between the Shan warlord Khun Sa and the Burmese government results in Burmese troops occupying territory also claimed by Thailand. The warlord Khun Sa and his army provided a buffer between Thailand and Burma by holding the contested border territory. Subsequent to the peace agreement, Burmese troops move in the area and remain. The dispute takes place in Doi Lang, 672 km north of Bangkok."
4004,"Vietnamese troops move into six villages four to five km inside Cambodian territory, forcing the evacuation of the local population and digging fortifications. The area is the Suay Rieng province, Duong sub-district in Cambodia. Cambodia dispatches approximately 300 troops to block any further advance of Vietnamese forces. The occupied territory is claimed by both states."
4005,Repair crew from India working on the embankment of the Muhari River is fired upon by Bengali troops on the opposite riverbank. Indian border security forces return gunfire. The clash takes place in the Belonia subdivision of South Tripura (India) on the banks of the Muhari River bordering India and Bangladesh.
4006,"A possible military coup in Bangladesh is followed by an alert of regular Indian military forces and border security forces. Indian fears of refugees entering India are given as a possible reason for the alert. Border security forces on the frontiers of the Indian states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, West Bengal, and Manipur on the India/Bangladesh border are placed on high alert."
4007,This dispute is related to the conflict between India and Pakistan over control of the contested territory of Kashmir that has existed since 1947. The territory was divided by force in 1948 and is a source of continuing hostility and violence in the relationship between the two states.

4008,"Vietnamese patrol boats capture Thai fishing vessels while operating in waters claimed by both states. Subsequent to the approach of a Thai gunboat, an exchange of gunfire occurs between the Thai and Vietnamese naval vessels. The dispute occurs in the Gulf of Thailand, 138 nautical miles east of the southern Thai province of Songkhla."
4009,"The 1200 mile border between Colombia and Venezuela is not well marked, and has frequently been the scene of cross-border incidents involving Colombian guerrillas or drug traffickers and Venezuelan forces. For example, on February 26, 1995, 150-200 Colombian rebels attacked a Venezuelan naval post, killing eight soldiers and wounding four. Venezuelan President Caldera urged his Colombian counterpart Samper to punish those responsible for the attack; Samper expressed his condolences. In March, defense ministers from both sides met to discuss the problems along their common border, and both sides increased the number of troops on the border to stop the rebels. In October a series of drug related incidents occurred along the border. On October 8, 1995, Venezuelan national guardsmen harassed nine Colombian farmers on the Colombian side of the border. Venezuela admitted that the incident took place, but claimed that the Colombians were poppy farmers and the guardsmen had crossed the border in “hot pursuit.” Again in early October, Colombian authorities claimed that Venezuelan guardsmen killed and decapitated a Colombian farmer on Colombian territory; Venezuela responded that the farmer was growing poppy. Also in October, Venezuela arrested five Colombian men growing poppy on the Colombian side of the border. Colombian President Samper said it was unacceptable that Venezuelans crossed the border. Venezuela, on the other hand, claimed that they arrested the men on their side of the border. Finally, in November, 1995, both sides agreed to end the border dispute and mark the border with signposts."
4010,"Honduras and El Salvador had a long-running territorial claim that was submitted to the World Court. Following the Court’s 1992 that awarded Honduras some of the disputed territory, Honduras agreed not to militarize the area due to its predominantly Salvadoran population. In January of 1993, the Honduran army was reported to be militarizing the territory and setting up checkpoints by the residents of Nahuaterique. El Salvador sent a protest note to Honduras in February. A year later, on September 10, 1994, the Presidents of Honduras and El Salvador met to draw up a new border based on the 1992 World Court ruling. The negotiations ended with the creation of a commission. By November 1994 the Honduran Defense Minister announced that tensions on the border had decreased significantly. In December 1994, both countries agreed to complete the demarcation of some 50 kilometers of their border by February 1995. During the process El Salvador continued patrols on the border to prevent incidents."
4011,"In April 1995, following an agreement on their ongoing conflict over the territorial waters in the Gulf of Fonseca, Nicaraguan armed forces captured four Honduran fishing boats and eight fishermen; each side claimed that the Honduran fishermen were in its own territorial waters when arrested. The boats were brought to a nearby island by Nicaraguan authorities, followed by Honduran police and naval authorities. An armed skirmish took place, as Nicaragua initiated the fire and Honduras responded. Another naval clash occurred on May 31 as Honduran armed forces tried to prevent Nicaraguan armed forces from arresting Honduran fishermen in the Gulf of Fonseca, who were allegedly fishing in Nicaraguan waters. Nicaragua asked Honduras to intervene to prevent “future incidents.” Following this incident, a Nicaraguan officer was detained by Honduras while he was either standing guard over a captured Honduran fishing boat or trying to tow a captured fishing boat to port (reports vary). He was returned to Nicaragua on June 2, 1995, when Nicaragua released the fishermen they had arrested. In order to prevent armed Honduran fishermen from coming to their territorial waters, on June 13, 1995, the Nicaraguan navy reinforced its forces patrolling its territorial waters in the Gulf of Fonseca by transferring additional boats to the area and intensifying patrol operations. Later in the month (June 16), Honduras and Nicaragua agreed to start demarcating the waters of the Gulf of Fonseca with buoys, starting in the first week of July.

4012,"The ongoing conflict between Honduras and Nicaragua over maritime zones in the Caribbean Sea once again led to militarized incidents. During the weekend of December 16-17, 1995, a Nicaraguan coast guard cutter boarded four Honduran fishing boats and arrested 106 crewmen. In a shootout, which Nicaragua claimed that Hondurans initiated, a Nicaraguan sailor and a Honduran fisherman were wounded. Nicaragua released 94 of the fishermen few days later, but held twelve fishermen and eight Nicaraguan sailors for questioning. They also promised to investigate the incident and apologized to Honduran authorities (this apology is why this activity was not coded as a militarized incident). On December 22, 1995, Honduras threatened to open fire on any Nicaraguan patrol boats in the disputed waters. Nicaragua announced that it would continue patrols off Cape Gracias a Dios on Nicaragua’s northern Atlantic coast, and warned that its navy boats would fire back (this Nicaraguan warning is not coded as a separate incident because of the coding guideline covering threats to defend oneself if attacked)."
4013,"In the 19th century when the Spanish Empire broke up, countries in the region inherited borders based on vague or contradictory Spanish colonial maps. Peru and Ecuador fought a 10-day engagement over one such border in 1941, leading to a decisive Peruvian victory. The agreement that followed (the 1942 Rio de Janeiro Protocol) awarded Peru 70,000 square miles of Amazon jungle. In 1960, Ecuador renounced the treaty, focusing on a renewed claim to the Cordillera del Condor area -- a small area that is believed to be rich in oil and mineral reserves, and that would give Ecuador an access to Amazon basin. In early 1995 tensions rose on the border. On January 5, Ecuadorean Defense Minister Gallardo denied reports of clashes. Large-scale fighting soon broke out, though, following clashes between Peruvian and Ecuadorean patrols from January 9-11. These clashes soon escalated, and both sides mobilized and deployed large numbers of troops to the border area. Between January 26th and March 2nd, continual clashes involved Peruvian and Ecuadorean planes, helicopters and ground troops erupted. Several ceasefires in late January and February led to temporary reductions in the fighting, but each was soon followed by renewed combat, On February 24, the OAS warned both sides to stop hostilities. Another cease-fire, the Itamaraty Declaration, was signed in Uruguay on March 1st. The agreement called for the withdrawal of troops and the placement of observers from guarantor countries (Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and the United States). Guarantor countries asked for guarantees on ceasefire before placing their observers. On March 6, Peru started withdrawing its troops from the disputed area. Despite the ceasefire, additional incidents continued to occur throughout March. On April 26, Ecuador pulled out last 160 troops it had in the disputed area, and on July 25 the two sides agreed to demilitarize more than 200 square miles; only 50 lightly armed soldiers from each side would remain in the disputed area (although this agreement did not settle the border issue itself)."
4014,"Guatemala had long claimed the British colony of British Honduras (Belize) to be Guatemalan territory. This claim had become less intense over time, and Guatemala recognized Belize’s independence in 1991 (ten years after the fact). The claim returned to prominence, though, following Great Britain’s May 1993 announcement that it would close its last military base in Belize and remove its 1,500 soldiers. On July 20, 1993 Belize’s Esquivel government suspended a territorial accord that had been signed by his predecessor before it was formally ratified, claiming that the previous government had made too many concessions. Guatemalan residents along the border with Belize claimed that on October 15th Belizean soldiers made an incursion to Guatemala and destroyed $60,000 worth of corn and rice crops. Belize claimed that the soldiers were operating on Belizean soil; neither side’s story was immediately confirmed. As a response, on October 16th, the Guatemalan government dispatched 60 soldiers to the disputed border. No further incidents occurred in the immediate aftermath of the incursion. On March 31, 1994, Guatemala reasserted its claim on Belizean territory. By the end of 1994, both countries announced that they were ready to renegotiate."
4015,"Guatemala has continued to claim Belize’s territory even after recognized Belize’s independence in 1991 (ten years after the fact). Since 1991, Guatemala has been calling for a negotiated settlement for the access they want to the Caribbean. According to Guatemalan media, Belizean soldiers crossed the border to Guatemala on August 25, 1995 in the northern El Peten department. They threatened to destroy crops and evict peasant farmers in the hamlet of Monte de Olivos. Later, sometime around September 9 or 10, 1995, another incursion occurred. This time Guatemalan government said that Belizean soldiers entered Guatemala near the village of Los Olivos. Belizean troops burned a dwelling, destroyed some crops, and “terrified” farmers. As a result, on September 11, 1995 Guatemalan government asked Belize to exercise the “utmost caution” at the common border to avoid further incidents. Following two incidents on their border with Belize, Guatemala sent elite soldiers to the disputed border and organized local farmers to monitor the area. Officials said the moves were made to “guard against a new incursion,” a preventive measure to protect Guatemalan farmers against actions by the Belizean army.

4016,"This dispute is comprised of a series of incidents generated by United States led efforts to restore the rule of Haitian President Aristide after he was deposed in a coup. The incidents begin with a naval blockade in October of 1993 where the United States was joined by a number of other nations (Argentina, Canada, the Dominican Republic, France, Haiti, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom). As the blockade wore on, and the military junta led by General Cedras remained in place, the United States resorted to a number of threats of military action and displays of force. The dispute was resolved with the return of Aristide only after the intercession of US Special Envoy Jimmy Carter. An invasion force was in the air as the deal was brokered. "
4017,"Italy sent troops to its border with Slovenia. This border area had been used to smuggle arms, explosives and people across. The Italian government had uncovered evidence that there were links between Italian organized crime and the flow of weapons to Bosnia. But the immediate concern of the Italian government was that Bosnian Serb leaders had threatened retaliation against any country involved in NATO air strikes. Source: The New York Times.

4018,"Between January and April 1993, North Korea provoked a series of 42 incidents with Chinese border guards. Reports indicate that North Korean forces fired more than 700 bullets at Chinese forces. The 42 incidents are only reported vaguely and this dispute is really composed of one incident as a surrogate for those 42 incidents. These incidents occurred in the wake of a deterioration of PRK-China relations that included the suspension of flights between PRK & China and anti- Chinese broadcasts by PRK. This deterioration of relations began with the establishment of relations between China and South Korea."

The naval craft closed within ""half a mile"" of Chinese vessels and fighter jets conducted renaissance flights in the area. On March 25, 1995, Philippines seized four Chinese fishing vessels sailing near an island claimed by Philippines. Philippines sentenced the new crew to 10 months in jail. China demanded the return of the crew and called the verdict ""illegal."" On May 13, 1995, China and Philippines engaged in mutual ""show of force"", in which Chinese vessels blocked a Philippine navy vessel sailing toward the Spratlys.

4028,"This dispute is based on a couple of consecutive militarized incidents between China and Philippines over control of the disputed Spratly Islands. In December 1996, Philippines upgraded its capabilities in the Spratlys to prepare for a possible conflict with China. Four months later, in April 1997, four armed Chinese vessels were spotted in the Spratly Islands and cruised near Kota and Panata Islands where Philippine troops are stationed. In response, Philippines scrambled fighter jets for patrol missions. Furthermore, they consequently deployed an additional company of marines (approximately 200 men). Philippine forces were also placed on alert in response to the sightings of Chinese warships. Philippines also deployed naval vessels to the disputed Scarsborough Shoal and blocked the entry of three non-governmental Chinese boats into the area in, again, April 1997. In May 1997, Philippines arrested 21 Chinese fishermen for poaching off the Scarsborough Shoal. In June 1997, Philippines blasted concrete slabs and pulled up buoys in an area of the Spratly Islands.

4075,"The origins of this dispute go back to 1988, when the Bougainville Revolutionary Army wanted to join Solomon Islands. The dispute is related to three consecutive militarized incidents between Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands. The first incident (OC00003) is an exchange of fire between Solomon Islands ground forces based on Shortland Island and an aircraft belonging to Papuan Defence Force. The second incident (OC 00002) is about the landing of four Papuan soldiers on the Solomon Island of Ovau and their subsequent attempt to land on the larger Mono Island. The final incident (OC00025) is a sea clash off Bougainville Island between patrol boats from Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands on the eve of the resumption of border talks."
4076,"This dispute is based on three incidents between Papua New Guinea and Solomon Islands. The first incident (OC 00006) is related to the incursions of the Papuan patrol boats into the Solomon Islands waters and their firing on a village in ""hot pursuit of rebels from Bougainville"" (according to the Papuan Prime Minister). The second incident (OC 00008) occurred when one of the Solomon Islands patrol boats forced a Papuan defense vessel to turn back in Solomon waters by firing warning shots. The final incident (OC 00007) is related to the illegal border crossings of Papuan Defense Force soldiers into the Solomons’ territory. It is claimed by Solomon Islands that the Papuan troops crossed from Bougainville to Telube in the Shortlands, and crossed to Sasamungga in Choiseul Province. Papua New Guinea's military commander defended these incursions into the Solomons’ territory by resistance forces on Bougainville that are allied to the Papuan army.

4079,"This dispute between Ethiopia and Sudan started with various reports that Sudanese civilians were stealing materials (trees for firewood) from Ethiopia. Ethiopian forces sent to protect civilians and their property then clashed with Sudanese forces on several occasions. Aside from border issues, each government repeated accused the other of provocative behavior. Ethiopia (as with other states in the area) accused Sudan of exporting Islamic fundamentalist terrorism, while Sudan accused Ethiopia of actively supporting Sudanese rebels."
4081,"Eritrea accuses Sudan of exporting terrorism to create Islamic regimes in the region. Sudan also accuses Eritrea of sponsoring opposition parties that seek to topple the Sudanese government. Sudan militarized this disagreement in response to a meeting of Sudanese opposition forces in Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. Eritrea openly supported this effort to coordinate opposition forces, and Sudan feared an attack from these groups from the East."
4082,"Following its independence from Ethiopia in 1993, Eritrea has been involved in several disputes (diplomatic and militarized) with its neighbors and nearby countries. This dispute between Eritrea and Djibouti involves territory. Eritrea claims a 500-sq.km piece of territory in northern Djibouti based on a 1935 Italian colonial map. In the two incidents included in this dispute, Djibouti objected to an Eritrean military incursion into the area in late 1995 and the shelling of a frontier post by Eritrean forces in 1996. No deaths occurred in this dispute. Media sources speculate that Eritrea was suspicious of Djibouti based on its relatively close relationship with Yemen, a country that had a more serious dispute with Eritrea in the mid-1990s."
4083,"Relations between Kenya and Uganda deteriorated in March 1995, leading up to a Ugandan troop build-up along the northeastern border with Kenya. The troop deployment, starting March 22, was aimed at curbing alleged incursions into Uganda by Kenya security forces. Uganda claimed that Kenyan security forces entered Uganda, burnt villages and killed the father of a prominent Ugandan parliamentarian. Relations between Kenya and Uganda had been tense following Uganda’s refusal to hand over the leader of an alleged Kenyan guerrilla movement, Brig. John Odongo, from exile in Uganda, who has since been relocated to Ghana. In early March, 200 attackers believed to belong to the February Eighteen Movement raided a police post in western Kenya killing administration policemen and getting away with 13 guns and 1,300 rounds of ammunition. The Kenyan border violation was in response to this rebel attack originating from Uganda. "
4084,"Relations between Kenya and Uganda deteriorated in March 1995, with both accusing the other of harboring armed opposition groups. Kenya violated the Ugandan border in search of Kenyan rebels in March 1995, and Uganda responded with a troop buildup along the border. This dispute (#4083) was left unsettled. Then later in November 1995, another dispute involved a Kenyan military buildup along the border, which Kenya said was justified by fears that Uganda was about to invade “with the help of Kenyan rebels and South African mercenaries.” Leaders of both countries met in early 1996 to remove the suspicion that had built up in 1995. Both pledged cooperation in the fight against bandits and rebels along their common border in the future."

4087,"This dispute consisted of 49 incidents that occurred between 10/10/94 and 9/99. Although this is a large number of incidents over a long period of time, the longest duration between incidents was approximately 5.5 months. In addition, the pattern in which the incidents occurred suggests that they are linked and should be considered as one dispute. In the dispute, North Korea continually challenges South Korean territorial boundaries along the DMZ and in the waters along the Northern Limit Line. South Korea responds by placing its forces on alert, conducting military exercises, showing ships and planes, and clashing with North Korean vessels that cross into South Korean waters and North Korea troops that cross the DMZ. Despite the distinction between the land and naval incursions by North Korea, their timing close together suggests a broader effort to challenge South Korean borders. On 4/10/97 (incident FE00190) North Korean troops crossed the DMZ into South Korean territory. Less than 2 months later (FE00194), North Korean vessels crossed into South Korean waters and a clash between North and South Korean vessels ensued. Slightly more than one later (FE00192), on 7/10/97 North Korean troops again crossed the DMZ and another clash ensued. Furthermore, throughout this period North Korean submersibles violated both South Korean waters and land. The South Korean reaction to these incidents also suggests that they were viewed as broader challenges to South Korean territory rather than separate challenges along the DMZ. For example, as a result of the 7/16/97 clash in the DMZ, South Korea placed its forces along both the DMMMZ and Northern Limit Line on alert in incident FE00217. During the dispute the incidents of highest severity included: 12/17/94 - North Korean forces shot down an American helicopter that had strayed across the DMZ (FE00038), 5/30/95-North Korea fired at and seized a South Korean fishing vessel that had strayed into North Korean waters, 6/5/97 - A clash between North and South Korean vessels when a North Korean vessel crossed into Southern waters (FE00194), 7/16/97-A clash between North and South Korean troops when 14 North Korean troops crossed the DMZ (FE00192), 9/9/97-South Korean forces intercepted and killed a North Korean soldier that had crossed teh DMZ (FE00199), 12/18/98-A clash occurred when South Korean forces chased and fired upon a North Korean semi-submersible that had crossed into South Korean territory (FE00238), 6/15/99-A naval clash ensued when South Korean vessels rammed North Korean vessels that were violating South Korean waters (FE00268 & FE00267). Interspersed between these major actions were threats, border fortifications, alerts, and shows of force."
4088,"This dispute consists of 19 militarized incidents involving China, Taiwan, and the US. The overriding issue throughout this dispute is Chinese concern that Taiwan is moving toward independence from the mainland. As a result, China conducted a series of alerts, threats, and shows of force aimed at intimidating Taiwan. The Chinese shows of force included military exercises, missile tests, the deployment of missiles near Taiwan, and increased fighter sorties by Chinese jets near Taiwan. Taiwan responded to these actions by repeatedly placing its forces on alert and launching its own fighters when China conducted sorties near Taiwan. The tensions increased in late July 1999 when Chinese jets crossed the dividing line separating Taiwan and China on 2 separate occasions. The US responded to the increased tensions by deploying two aircraft carrier groups to the region in July and August 1999. The threats and shows of force by both sides continued into 2000. In February 2000 China passed a guided missile destroyer purchased from Russia through the Taiwan Strait in an effort to intimidate Taiwan. The United States responded by deploying the USS Kitty Hawk air craft carrier group to the region in late February."

Starting from October 28, 1998, Philippines protested against the intrusion of several armed Chinese vessels and cargo ships near a group of islands in the Spratlys. This incident is reported as China's show of force against Philippines and the end day is unclear. China was reported to be constructing structures on the area. In response to China's naval movements in the Spratlys, Philippines engaged in a counter show of force by increasing naval patrols in the area in order to prevent the entrance and exit of Chinese naval vessels (starting in November 1998). China protested the increase of Philippine patrols. On November 11, 1998, Philippines placed its forces on alert in the South China Sea in response to Chinese encroachment on one of the disputed reefs. The Philippine navy was ordered to ""shoot across the bow"" of any intruding Chinese ships. On November 29, 1998, Philippines arrested twenty Chinese fishermen fishing on the Spratly Islands and detained their boats. China protested the Philippine action. The reports state that the fishermen were still under detention as of December 21, 1998. On May 23, 1999, a Philippine navy vessel chased and collided with a Chinese fishing vessel near the Scarborough Shoal. The Chinese vessel sank as a result of the collision, which Philippines labeled as ""accidental."" China expressed ""strong displeasure"" for the incident. On July 19, 1999, a Philippine navy ship chased two Chinese fishing vessels in the Spratly Islands. The Philippine vessel fired warning shots at one of the fishing vessels before ramming the fishing boat. The Philippine side claimed that the ramming was accidental. China filed a protest in response to the Philippine show of force. On October 30, 1999, Vietnamese troops allegedly shot a Philippine air force plane flying over Pigeon Reef (a reef controlled by Vietnam). Vietnam accused Philippines of seriously violating Vietnam's sovereignty and reiterated its claim to sovereignty over all the Spratly Islands. In the first two months of 2000, Philippines navy boarded several Chinese fishing vessels and fired warning shots across the bows of two Chinese vessels near the Scarborough Shoal.

Sudan seizes Egyptian property in Khartoum and stages army exercises as a show of force. Sudanese officials even talked of mobilization; there were however no formal steps in that direction. Egyptian- Sudanese ties began deteriorating shortly after Gen. Omar Al Bashir seized power in Khartoum in 1989 and installed a Muslim fundamentalist government. The tensions grew in 1990 when Bashir's government backed Iraq during the Gulf War, and again in 1991 when Sudan granted a Canadian oil firm concessions in the disputed border area claimed by Egypt. Egypt has for more than a year accused Sudan of collaborating with Iran in arming, financing and training Muslim militants to carry out acts of subversion and violence in Egypt. Egypt claims ownership to Halaib and offshore areas in the red sea under an 1899 agreement that set the frontier along the 22nd parallel. It has said Egypt gave Sudan administrative powers in Halaib in 1902 because Sudanese tribes inhabited the triangular enclave. Sudan contends the Egyptian claim and says it has ""full sovereignty"" over the Halaib area."

4136,Yugoslavia fortified border with Albania and showed force in response to civil unrest in Albania involving the legitimacy of the government and the situation in Kosovo. 
4137,"In response to Yugoslav military activity in the bordering Kosovo region, Albania, followed by other nations, took military action against Yugoslavia. Albania began by fortifying its border with Yugoslavia, and engaged in numerous subsequent incidents with Yugoslavia over its stance toward ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Beginning in mid-1998, NATO states began conducting military exercises and other shows of force and began to threaten Yugoslavia with airstrikes if it did not change its Kosovo policy. Yugoslavia responded with mobilizations and other militarized actions. From 3/24/99, NATO countries began carrying out airstrikes against Yugoslavia, which acceded to NATO demands to leave Kosovo in early June 1999. NATO bombings ceased on 6/10/99."
4138,"This dispute involves demarcation of territorial waters between Myanmar and Thailand. In this instance, a Thai fishing trawler in the disputed territorial waters is attacked by an armed Burmese fishing boat. A Thai naval vessel responds to the distress call and is fired upon by the Burmese fishing boat. The Thai patrol boat returns fire and is subsequently attacked by two Burmese frigates. The Thai vessel returns fire against the Burmese frigates. Burma's claim to the waters is based on old British charts, while Thailand's claim rests on charts drafted by France. The exchange of gunfire occurs off the west coast of Thailand, near the city of Ranong."
4140,"On November 30, 1999, the Honduran parliament ratified a maritime treaty with Colombia that had been signed in 1986.The treaty covered the Caribbean Sea and recognized the San Andres Archipelago, also claimed by Nicaragua, as Colombian territory. On December 1, 1999, Nicaragua put its military forces on alert. The treaty covered the Caribbean Sea recognizing San Andres Archipelago, claimed by Nicaragua, as Colombian territory. Nicaraguan President Aleman also announced that they would break the preferential trade relations with Honduras by imposing a 35 percent “patriotic tax” on imports from Honduras. On December 3, 1999, Honduran Defense Minister alleged that following the ratification of their treaty with Colombia, about 60 Nicaraguan soldiers were deployed on the border near Honduran town of Trojes. Honduran citizens also claimed that they saw Nicaraguan soldiers near Gausaule. Nicaragua denied the allegations. Honduras asked neutral observers from UN or OAS to monitor the border, and the UN announced that it was ready to provide assistance, but by December 6 the Nicaraguans appeared to be withdrawn. Also on December 3, 1999, Nicaragua protested Honduran troop movements in the Platano River Biosphere area that had begun on November 29 to combat drug smuggling and illegal logging. Honduras called off the exercises called “Operation Jaguar.” On December 7, both sides pledged to the UN that they would solve their problems diplomatically, and the OAS became involved in mediating the dispute. On December 30, 1999, OAS mediator Einaudi announced that, pending a World Court decision, Nicaragua and Honduras had agreed on an immediate separation of their forces on the border. Later on January 13, the Central American Court of Justice asked the suspension of the Nicaraguan tariff, which Nicaragua did in less than a month. A military buffer zone was also set up, and both countries agreed on 8 February 2000 to reduce the number of troops on the border. Additional incidents continued, though. Nicaragua's ambassador to the WTO accused Honduras of moving troops to the border in April -- a charge that Honduras denied -- and warned Honduras and Colombia of ""unforeseen consequences"" of their naval presence in disputed Caribbean waters. In July 2000, Nicaragua twice protested the Honduran occupation of four islets (Sur, Robel, Arrecife Alargado, and Media Luna) in the Caribbean Sea, claiming Nicaraguan ownership. The Honduran Foreign Ministry responded by claiming that the islets were Honduran property, and there is no further information on the islets afterward."
4141,"Following the 1999 ratification of a 1986 maritime treaty between Honduras and Colombia, Nicaragua and Honduras experienced a series of disputes on their territorial waters. On February 15, 2000, Nicaragua’s Vice Foreign Minister requested Honduras to fulfill its promise to dismantle the army camp on the Cayo Sur islet in the Caribbean, which was set up after the ratification. He also pointed out that their forces knew “how to fight” and had the modern technology to do so. The Honduran government reacted by calling this appeal “hostile and warlike.” Four days later, on February 19, 2000, Nicaraguan and Honduran speed boats clashed in the Gulf of Fonseca. Both countries blamed each other for initiating the incident. This was followed by a second incident on February 25, 2000. Nicaragua claimed that a Honduran navy vessel entered Nicaraguan territorial waters and opened fire on two Nicaraguan patrol boats that had been stationed in the area to prevent illegal fishing. Nicaraguan boats pursued the Honduran vessel until it reached Honduran waters. Honduran officials claimed that Nicaraguan boats initiated the fire. On March 7, tensions started to decrease with a Nicaragua- Honduras border accord sponsored by the OAS. According to the accord, until the International Court of Justice rules on the case, the two countries agreed to conduct joint patrols in the area. Later in April, Nicaragua continued to seize Honduran fishing boats in the Gulf of Fonseca, claiming they were fishing in Nicaraguan territorial waters. Finally, in May, the two countries agreed to mark their maritime border."
4143,"After fighting over a 45-mile stretch of their border in January and February of 1995, Peru and Ecuador experienced rising tensions in the same area later that year. Following the ceasefire both sides withdrew from the disputed area and created a demilitarized zone. Ecuador subsequently claimed that Peru and Ecuador had engaged in isolated incidents at the disputed region on September 20 and 21. Peru initially denied that the incidents took place, but later confirmed the incidents and claimed Peruvian troops “took initiatives not approved by their superiors.” Both sides agreed in October to hold talks in January, but new incidents broke out before the talks could begin. On December 27, Peru claimed that Ecuadorean forces opened fire on its soldiers and violated its airspace. Peru placed its troops on immediate alert, cancelled New Year’s leave for troops along the border, and airlifted troops and supplies to the border zone. In early January, Peru claimed that an Ecuadorean aircraft violated its airspace and that Ecuadorean soldiers opened fire on a Peruvian post in the demilitarized zone. It was also then reported that Peru was massing troops along the border and Ecuador was erecting barricades. Talks began on January 16, 1996. On March 1 and March 4, both countries signed a memorandum of understanding to promote “mutual confidence.” Occasional incidents continued, though. On March 12, 1996, Peru claimed that an Ecuadorean airplane violated Peruvian airspace. On July 19, Ecuador began military exercises codenamed “Soberania” (sovereignty) in provinces neighboring Peru; Peru protested these exercises as a violation of the peace accord. By October 29, 1996, a procedural agreement for border talks was reached, although by the end of the year both sides had purchased advanced warplanes and tensions remained high."
4144,"Two years after their near-war in the Cordillera del Condor region, tensions rose again between Peru and Ecuador before any permanent agreement was reached. On May 13, 1997, Peruvian soldiers captured seven Ecuadorean soldiers. Peru claimed the soldiers had been planting mines four miles inside Peruvian territory. Ecuador, on the other hand, claimed that the soldiers had been deactivating mines on their side of the border when Peruvian soldiers entered Ecuador and kidnapped them. The seven soldiers were returned to Ecuador through the MOMEP international peacekeeping monitors on May 15. A month later, Ecuador claimed that a Peruvian helicopter violated Ecuadorean airspace on June 9, 1997. The border violation was photographed by Ecuadorean soldiers near Vega military base. Peru denied the accusations and claimed that its airspace had been violated by Ecuadorian aircraft 35 times, although there was no proof supporting these accusations. Between September 1-6 Peru held large-scale air, land, and naval exercises near the disputed border area. These exercises were described as “routine.” On October 19, according to Peruvian officials, two mortar grenades were launched from Ecuador against Peru’s Vencedores Guard Post; the first grenade was an illumination shell to help aim the second. Ecuadorian officials denied the incident took place. In order to avoid a major crisis, Peru and Ecuador sped up their negotiations to reach a permanent solution. Officials met in Brasilia from November 24-28. By January 19, 1998, a working timetable was agreed on. However, the May 30 deadline for signing a final agreement was delayed."
4145,"Nicaragua and Colombia were involved in a disagreement over territorial waters and fishing rights in the Caribbean Sea. This disagreement focused around the archipelago of San Andres and Providencia, which Colombia had obtained in a 1928 treaty. In April 1994, Nicaragua detained two Colombian fishing boats in the area, claiming that they were on Nicaraguan territorial waters for an undetermined period of time. Even though there do not appear to be any other related incidents, this was described as causing “a diplomatic conflict.” Despite Nicaraguan authorities announcing their willingness to solve the conflict peacefully, incidents continued to take place in the region."
4146,"Nicaragua-Costa Rica relations have been problematic in many issues. In January 1995, Costa Rica expelled thousands of illegal Nicaraguans residing in Costa Rica. Nicaraguan press claimed that Costa Rican farmers exploited and mistreated Nicaraguans. They also have different views on the navigation on San Juan border river. During the most recent of these disputes, according to Nicaraguan government, on March 3, 1995, 13 members of the Costa Rican civil guards crossed the border to Nicaragua while pursuing illegal immigrants. They were seized by Nicaraguan forces. In a retaliatory act, on March 5, 1995, two Nicaraguan policemen were arrested by Costa Rican authorities after they crossed the border “to get a drink of water.” By March 6, 1995, the two sides had exchanged their prisoners."
4147,"On July 16, 1998, an incident occurred over navigation rights on the San Juan River separating Nicaragua and Costa Rica. A Nicaraguan patrol boat stopped a Costa Rican patrol boat, claiming that Costa Rican guards were not allowed to carry weapons on the river, which belongs to Nicaragua. Following two weeks of protests, the two countries reached a new agreement on July 30, 1998. This new agreement allowed Costa Rican guards to carry weapons on the river, but also required them to report to various Nicaraguan military stations along the river. In August, following renewed Nicaraguan prohibition of Costa Rican moves with weapons on the San Juan River, Costa Rican President ordered a “heavy” military deployment on the border. Nicaragua reacted by suspending free navigation on August 3, 1998 and voided the agreement that had been signed in July. After nearly two years of uncertainty, a navigation rights agreement was reached on July 3, 2000."
4148,"In an incident related to fishing rights in the area around the South Georgia Islands, a United Kingdom patrol boat (Cordelia) seized one of ten Chilean fishing boats in the area, on March 6, 1996. The seized boat (Antonio Lorenzo) was escorted to Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands. This was one of many captures by the United Kingdom patrols in the area in recent days after the UK began enforcing a new claim to 200 miles of exclusive fishing rights around the islands; the other cases were not coded because there were no protests. Chile called for the immediate release of the fishing boat, claiming it was seized in international waters, although it is unclear when the boat or its crew were released. On March 19, 1996, Argentina and Chile made a common declaration rejecting United Kingdom control in the area. "
4149,"The Venezuela – Trinidad and Tobago fishing agreement expired in 1995. On October 30, 1996, the Venezuelan coast guard shot at a Trinidad and Tobago fishing boat (Hannah) in the Columbus Channel. Trinidadian fisherman claimed that Venezuelans rammed and fired at their ship. Venezuela, on the other hand, claimed that Trinidadian fishermen initiated the fire and rammed into their ship. The two countries exchanged protest letters on October 31, 1996. These letters led to talks between representatives on November 7, 1996."
4150,"In the ongoing territorial dispute between Guatemala and Belize tensions rose in August 1997. In one of several occasions where Belizean soldiers crossed the border to Guatemala, near the villages Sarstun and El Carrizal, Belizean soldiers supposedly entered Guatemala. Farmers accused Belizean soldiers of destroying crops that they claimed were planted in Belizean territory. Some Guatemalans also claimed that they were threatened with eviction from the land. Following these incursions, on August 26, 1997, claiming that Belizean movements “injured Guatemalan sovereignty” Guatemala’s president ordered troops to the border. Following these moves, officials agreed to meet in September to discuss the issue. It was not clear if the meeting took place"
4151,"Guatemala has been seeking the return of 12,272 square kilometers of land from Belize (more than half of Belize’s land mass) since that country’s independence in 1981. On February 24, 2000, as part of this ongoing territorial claim, 25 Guatemalan soldiers detained three Belizean soldiers and a policeman. Each country claimed that the incident took place in its own territory. According to Guatemalan officials, the Belizeans were captured outside the municipality of San Fransisco in the northern Guatemalan city of Peten. The incident was seen as a retaliation for Belizean soldiers’ shooting of a Guatemalan farmer in December 1999 (some sources say January 2000). Even though the Belizeans were released by the Guatemalan Supreme Court, the incident led to the cancellation of border talks that had been scheduled to start in Miami on March 4. Belize also started military maneuvers near the border, drawing two Guatemalan protests (March 8 and 11) and leading to the Belizean Ambassador’s eviction from Guatemala on March 8. Guatemalan Foreign Minister Orellana said Belize was “playing with fire,” and indicated that Guatemala considered the troop movements as provocation. Guatemalan officials also emphasized that they would not respond militarily and preferred a diplomatic solution. As a response to the Belizean maneuvers, the Guatemalan government announced that starting on March 17, 2000, they increased their surveillance patrols on the border. They brought the garrison in the area from 300 to 350 in order to prevent any further incidents; the increase lasted at least through mid-April, which is the time of the last report on this subject."
4152,"On the disputed border between Guatemala and Belize, tensions rose following an incursion by Belizean soldiers to the one kilometer “proximity zone” that had been set up om each side of the border with OAS assistance. Guatemalan Foreign Minister Orellana announced that on December 28 and 29, 2000, Belizean soldiers violated the “proximity zone” and placed boundary markers near the Guatemalan regions of Santa Cruz Rio Blanco and Peten. Guatemala announced that they were watching Belizean activities and that they would not be provoked. The tension was eased in early January, 2001, when Belize called off the eviction of 221 Guatemalans settled on the disputed territory. Earlier Belize had claimed that these families were settled one mile inside Belizean territory. Later in February the Belizean government changed its mind about these families and re-ordered them to leave because they were in a protected ecological area. Following a round of negotiations at Barbados, Belizean Prime Minister Said Musa announced that even though he was hopeful that some progress in the dispute would be achieved, he did not think that an “amicable settlement” would be reached in the short run. Nonetheless, on May 13, 2001, 30 Belizean soldiers harassed and then expelled at least 15 Guatemalan families from a village in the ""buffer zone"" on the disputed border. Tensions remained after this incident, but Guatemala and Belize continued to hold peace talks over the larger territorial question between them with OAS mediation."
4153,"In an ongoing territorial waters dispute over fishing rights in the Gulf of Fonseca, a Salvadoran naval force seized a Nicaraguan boat on March 7, 1997 for fishing in waters claimed by El Salvador. The Nicaraguan navy sent a boat to rescue the seized fishing boat but due to a mechanical problem the navy boat sank on the route, killing all six occupants. It was not clear what happened to the seized fishing boat"
4154,"The maritime border in the Gulf of Paria, which had been established between Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago in 1990, experienced rising tensions in mid- April 1997, based on specific disagreements over fishing and oil exploration rights. Venezuela claimed that Trinidad and Tobago’s state oil company and Texaco were conducting illegal exploratory drilling in Venezuelan waters. They sent troops on an armed vessel to board the drilling platform and a tugboat. Trinidad and Tobago Foreign Minister warned Venezuela that the situation was “heading into very deep waters.” This incident was followed by multiple cases where Venezuelans fired at, arrested, jailed, or fined crews and captains of Trinidadian fishing boats. Trinidad and Tobago authorities encouraged negotiations to reduce the tension between two countries, with the government raising the issue before the OAS, and increased coast guard patrols in Trinidadian waters. Nonetheless, Venezuela kept warning that they would continue to preserve their integrity and sovereignty. The seized TRI fishermen were released from Venzuelean prisons on May 28. By early-August 1997, the relations between two countries were back to normal as a result of meetings between authorities."
4155,"The maritime border dispute between Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago flared during early August 1999, when the Venezuelan National Guard boarded a Trinidad and Tobago fishing boat. They also arrested two fishermen and sent them to Caracas. The Trinidad and Tobago coast guard claimed that Venezuelan officials threw the captain of the fishing boat overboard, hands and legs bound. Trinidad and Tobago officials claimed that the area where the incident took place was open to fishermen from both countries since an agreement signed in 1998. Trinidad and Tobago officials sent a letter of protest to Venezuelan Foreign Ministry and a Foreign Ministry official to assist the two fishermen whp had been taken to Caracas."
4156,"During a dispute about oil exploration rights granted by Guyana in the territorial waters claimed by Suriname, Guyanese officials claimed that on June 3, 2000, a Surinamese aircraft intruded into Guyanese airspace on a reconnaissance mission. The same night one or two (depending on reports) Surinamese boats came to the mouth of the disputed Corentyne River between the two countries. Surinamese forces ordered the CGX oil rig (a Canadian oil exploration company operating under a Guyanese permit) to leave the area in 12 hours. CGX moved its rig outside the disputed area. Guyanese officials issued a protest, but the Surinamese government claimed they were protecting their rights and territory. While Foreign Minister level negotiations were going on between Guyana and Suriname, Guyana started to deploy “a few hundred soldiers” along the river on June 4; the Guyanese government confirmed the reports. The following day, on June 5, as a response to the Guyanese buildup along the Corentyne River, Suriname started to send anti-aircraft weapons, troops, low flying aircraft, and gunboats to the border. Despite a second round of Foreign Minister level negotiations starting on June 6th, which resulted in a joint communiqué, Guyana accused Suriname on June 10 of violating its airspace. Locals along the border said both sides were guilty of airspace."
4157,"Following the transfer of Guyana from Dutch to British ownership at the turn of the 19th century Guyana and Suriname, two countries experienced problems regarding their undetermined border. The Corentyne River is one of the disputed areas. Suriname has been strengthening its army in near past while Guyanese coast guard has been under-funded. In September 2000, Surinamese soldiers pursued an unlicensed speedboat to shore at Scotsburg, Guyana. The boat was occupied either by civilians or by criminals/smugglers. Residents in the area claimed shots were fired during the incident and that Surinamese soldiers tried to relaunch the boat in the water. The Guyanese complaint was based on the fact that the incident took place on their territory. The two countries’ presidents talked about the incident when they met at the South American leaders’ summit in Brazil. Guyana’s President Venetiaan said that the incident should not be exaggerated and used as an excuse to raise tensions. Opposition in Guyana used this incident to call for increased military spending."
4158,Turkey enters into Iraq to attack PKK (Kurdish) forces based in Northern Iraq.
4159,This dispute consists of one incident in which Iran increased its border forces along the Afghan border and closed the border. The border closure was due to concern about the influx of Afghan refugees. Iran is coded as the revisionist state because its actions are aimed at checking the flow of refugees from Afghanistan by tightening control over the border.
4160,"This dispute consisted of 9 incidents between Iran and Afghanistan. The dispute was touched off by the deaths of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan. On 8/8/98, following the capture of Mazar-e Sharif, Taliban forces forced their way into the Iranian consulate and killed 8 Iranian diplomats. Following Iranian protests, Afghanistan began massing troops along the border later in August 1998. In response, Iran deployed 200,000 troops to the Iran-Afghanistan border as a show of force on 9/1/98. These troops remained in the area on alert. Afghanistan responded to the Iranian action by fortifying its border and threatening to target Iranian cities if Iran attacks. Iran violated the Afghan border on 10/2/98, increasing the level of hostility between the two sides. Hostility further increased on 10/8/93 when Taliban forces attacked an Iranian border post and a three-hour clash ensued. Iranian forces claimed to have destroyed 3 Afghan border posts and inflicted ""heavy"" casualties on Taliban forces. This dispute does not appear to have a clear revisionist actor. The Taliban is acting to consolidate its hold in northern Afghanistan and Iran's actions are in response to the death of her diplomats."
4161,This dispute consisted of one incident in which Iranian forces shelled Afghan forces as the Iranian-backed Hizbe Wahdat Afghan group suffered defeat to Taliban forces.

4171,"As a part of a longstanding dispute over fishing rights and territorial waters in the Gulf of Fonseca, Honduras claimed that Nicaraguan boats shot at Honduran fishermen in Honduran waters on January 9, 1997, and arrested fourteen of them. Nicaragua claimed that the incident took place in their territorial waters, and released the fishermen two days later but kept their eleven fishing boats. According to our sources two other seizures by Nicaragua took place in December 1996 and December 1997, but these did not draw protests from Honduras and were not coded. In mid-April, Nicaraguan navy boats seized several Honduran fishermen. This followed the arrest of four fishermen on April 17 and preceded the arrest of another eight on April 23. The Honduran Foreign Minister claimed that these arrests took place in Honduran territorial waters near the border. Later, on April 24, a Honduran naval force captured four Nicaraguan fishermen. On April 30 Nicaragua and Honduras agreed to exchange the arrested fishermen. Three Nicaraguan speedboats intercepted and confiscated a Honduran fishing boat on May 22. Honduran government claimed that the incident took place in their territorial waters. The Nicaraguan navy confiscated another 11 Honduran fishing boats on May 29, although Honduran naval forces intercepted and freed six of the boats. Around this same time, Nicaraguan boats fired at Honduran patrols. Claiming that the incidents took place in Nicaraguan waters, Nicaraguans called the Honduran protest “absurd.” Six of the 14 fishermen who were captured escaped shortly afterwards, and some of the remaining boats were returned by Nicaraguan authorities. Additional incidents took place in early August, when Nicaraguans several times seized Honduran fishing boats. By the end of September 1997 there was still no settlement in place."
4172,"Ongoing Venezuelan struggle with Colombian rebels crossing the border between two countries led to a new dispute. On February 6, 1997, about ten Colombian rebels from the ELN crossed the Venezuelan border and ambushed Venezuelan troops, wounding three soldiers. Venezuelans pursued the rebels back to the Arauca River along the border, where they fired on a boat that they believed to contain rebels. The boat was carrying Colombian civilians and as a result of Venezuelan fire, one child died, three children and two adults were hurt. While Colombian Foreign Minister protested Venezuelan “overreaction,” Venezuela protested the rebel attack. On April 9, 1997, both countries agreed to step up their military presence on the border to confront violence by Colombian rebels."

4182,"This dispute contains hundreds of militarized incidents between, primarily, Israel and Lebanon. Syria sporadically participated on the side of the Lebanese. Virtually all of the incidents occur when Israel attacks Hezbollah guerillas in Southern Lebanon in response to Hezbollah attacks on Israeli troops. Israeli violations of the Lebanese border, in an effort to monitor Hezbollah activities, are also common. Lebanon repeatedly protests the incursions, and often fights with the Hezbollah guerillas when the Israeli forces attack. The dispute begins in 1993 and continues through December 2001 with remarkably little change in the character of the incidents. The dispute is, therefore, still ongoing with no outcome or settlement."

4187,"This dispute includes two border fortifications, one by Djibouti against Eritrea, the other several months later by Eritrea against Djibouti. The first fortification was motivated by Djibouti’s desire to limit the potential for Eritrean forces to launch attacks against Ethiopia through Djibouti. Djibouti sided with Ethiopia in the war that erupted between Ethiopia and Eritrea in 1998. Reports regarding the second fortification suggest that Eritrea was demonstrating its displeasure by massing troops on the border with Djibouti, which allowed landlocked Ethiopia access to its seaports for supplies during the conflict."

4189,"After their short but bloody 1995 conflict in the Cordillera del Condor region, tensions continued to rise periodically between Ecuador and Peru. In late July, Peru charged, Ecuadorean troops had occupied a disputed portion of territory 11 kilometers long and 22.8 kilometers deep. Ecuador denied the allegations, but Peru refused to negotiate until the Ecuadorean troops pulled out. There were no clashes reported. Fujimori called off his trip to Colombia following Ecuador’s infiltration. On July 28, 1998, two Peruvian soldiers were injured after stepping on land mines near the disputed border. While Peru accused Ecuador for planting them, Ecuador claimed Peru was building up troops in the region. On August 1, 1998, Peru deployed heavily armed army contingents from Chachapoyas to El Milagro Base. In July, they had deployed troops from San Ignacio Base and Chachapoyas to El Milagro. Peru also prevented fishing boats in Tumbes from sailing off. Ecuador did not mobilize in response, but “strengthened its mechanisms” and asked MOMEP (the Ecuador-Peru Military Observers’ Mission) to expand its area of vigilance. Peru claimed that the movements were parts of “strictly preventive actions and military maneuvers” and rejected the protest by Ecuador Defense Minister on August 4. According to the media Peru was dissatisfied by the Ecuador’s lack of determination to sign a definitive peace treaty. As a result of an August 13 agreement MOMEP expanded its surveillance over the entire region. 16 Ecuadorian and 27 Peruvian bases erected during the 1995 fighting started being dismantled. Early in September, both militaries started to withdraw from the disputed region. After another Ecuadorian mine killed a Peruvian officer and injured another, Ecuador submitted a map of mined border areas to MOMEP. By the end of September 1998, two countries approved a draft trade and navigation treaty. The peace treaty was signed on October 26, in Brasilia. It gave a one square-kilometer of Peruvian territory, Tiwinza, in the middle of the jungle and another 34 kilometers on the border to Ecuador. In return, Peru received a 75 kilometer stretch of the border region. The border marking ceremony took place on January 19, 1999."

Based on this news article, we may suppose concerning ME00065 that Syria first committed a border fortification in reaction to the bomb explosion, accusing Turkey of attempting to kill Abdallah Ocalan, the leader of the Kurdistan Workers Party, who has been sheltered near Damascus in Syria. We may also suppose that Turkey responded by fortifying its border, and the US threatened Syria that it risks confrontation with the American military if Syria goes to War with Turkey.

4191,Turkish helicopters violated Iranian airspace and attacked a Kurdish village in northwest Iran.
4192,"This dispute entails several incidents between Iran and Iraq. In the first incident, Iran attacks on 7/27/1996 the Iranian rebel Kurds. Then, on 8/23/1996 Iran sent troops to Northern Iraq to participate in the battle between the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic party on the side of the former. As a result, Iraq protests accusing Iran of violating its sovereignty by shelling residential quarters in the Kurds-controlled northern Iraq. Then on 8/26/1996 an Iranian boat containing four armed people in military uniform seized an Iraqi fishing boat. Later, sometime during September of that same year Iraqi Deputy PM sent a message to the UN claiming that Iran was massing troops and conducting military exercises on its border with Iraq. Then on 1/3/1997, Iraq deployed three divisions of its armed forces along its border with Iran. (FG)"

4197,"Russia deployed seven bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons to bases in the Arctic as a ""training exercise."" These confrontations were routine during the Cold War but not at the time of this dispute. Canada and the United States responded by moving fighters and AWACS radar planes to northern bases to counter what NORAD described as a ""potential threat."" Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon stated, ""We would anticipate that, in the next few days, they [the Russians] might fly one or several of these planes through the Bering Straits and close to Alaska."" Russia deployed its planes sometime in late November - we assume November 26; the United States and Canada deployed their planes on November 30. It is not clear how long these deployments lasted. There is no evidence of future discussions among the participants regarding Russia's military presence in the Arctic. More specifically, it is not clear whether Russia removed its planes from the Arctic or whether Canada and United States decided to allow Russia to conduct future such training exercises in the Arctic."
4200,"Yemen charged that Eritrea was still seizing Yemeni fishing vessels from territorial waters, and referred to 24 fishermen detained by the Eritreans. Yemen said that ""piracy"" against Yemeni vessels by Eritrean patrols has been repeated, and that a patrol of the Eritrean coastal guard on August 21 seized six Yemeni fishing vessels along with the 24 fishermen aboard who were fishing in the high seas. Yemen and Eritrea had a territorial water dispute that flared after Eritrea seized the island of Greater Hanish in 1995. The International Court of Justice ruled the return of the island to Yemen in May 1998. By December 1999 Yemen and Eritrea have accepted the second ruling of the ICJ over their maritime boundaries. The ICJ stipulated that the boundary would be positioned equidistant between the two countries, while Yemen will retain some sovereignty over the Hanish islands, Eritrean fishermen will be allowed to fish in the area."
4201,"This dispute consists of 19 militarized incidents between 9/1999 and 3/2001 involving Russia, Uzbekistan, and Afghanistan. This dispute centers around the threat posed to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan by Islamic militants operating out of and being supported by Afghanistan. The dispute involves a series of alerts and border fortifications by Russian forces in Tajikistan as a means of countering threats from Afghanistan. At the same time, Afghanistan also placed its forces on alert and fortified its border. The highest level of conflict in the dispute occurred in June 2000 when a clash occurred between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan. The clash occurred when Uzbekistan launched airstrikes into Afghanistan. Afghan forces returned fire, shooting down and Uzbek plane & killing 2 pilots."
4203,"Yemen and Saudi Arabia have had problems with their border for many years (Mideast Mirror. Dec. 9, 1997, Section: Saudia Arabia, Yemen, Vol. 11, No. 239 refers to this as Yemen’s “decades-old border dispute with Saudi Arabia”). In 1995, they signed an agreement in which Yemen gave up its claims to three border provinces: Aassir, Najfan and Jizan. But there were other areas in dispute. Information about actions on the borders is vague. SAU would like to have a corridor to the Arabian Sea, and this would have to go through territory of Yemen and/or Oman. As well, some of the areas in dispute are “believed to be rich in oil deposits” (Agence France Press, Dec. 08. 1997, International News ). There are a number of confrontations between these two countries about disputed territory. In most cases, SAU takes the initiative on these matters. Note: MID 203 now includes incidents from MID 204.

4205,"This dispute involves three military incidents between Iran and Iraq. On September 29, 1997 Iran bombed rebel bases (the MKO) inside Iraq. Iraq responded by flying planes over the area - in violation of the US imposed No Fly Zones. No further incidents were recorded regarding the rebel group. In November of 1997 the Iraqis siezed an Iranian fishing crew after their boat sank on the Iraqi side of the Shattol=Arab River. Iran protested in April 1998, saying the crew had still not been released and demanded an explanation. This dispute should be viewed as evidence of continuing hostility between these two states."
4206,Turkey enters into northern Iraq to fight the Kurds. They eventually withdraw on their own timetable.
4208,Turkey again invades Iraq to attack the Kurds.
4210,On two separate occasions Turkish jets violate Greek airspace in the Aegean and are intercepted by Greek fighters.
4212,"The background of the dispute is that Chechen rebels had occupied two strategic gorges in Georgia, which Georgia appeared to be powerless to halt. Russia asked the Georgian government for permission to conduct attacks on those gorges and to use Georgian territory to facilitate further activity. Georgia refused this request. Nevertheless, Russian helicopters, gunships, and warplanes made several attacks on Chechen rebels near the Georgian-Chechen border, with some of the attacks taking place on Georgian territory. Georgia protested the attacks."
4213,USA patrol boats stopped and detained two Russian tankers suspected of carrying sanctioned Iraq oil from the Persian Gulf. Russian Foreign Minister demanded the immediate release of the tanker.
4214,"Equatorial Guinea seized Lithuanian fishing boat in international waters. Lithuania sent protest notes demanding its immediate release. Equatorial Guinea later charged the ship with illegal fishing; Lithuania protested again, claiming no fishing equipment was on board."
4215,"When USA and British planes bombed Iraq, Iraq claimed that Kuwait was part of the attack. In response, Kuwait placed its forces on alert."
4216,"With the hope of preventing an air war between Iraq and Iran, the United States ordered its aircraft carrier, Nimitz, to the Persian Gulf ahead of schedule. American officials described the order as a warning to Iran against launching another round of air attacks on Iraq in violation of the flight exclusion zones in northern and southern Iraq. Iranian aircraft violated the no-fly zone in southern Iraq when they attacked the bases of Iranian rebels who operated from Iraq. The action was also intended to deter Iraq from engaging an air war with Iran. Iran discontinued its attacks on targets in southern Iraq, although it did not indicate that it was acting in response to the United States' show of force."
4217,"On August 20, 1998 the United States launched a cruise missile attack against a suspected chemical weapons plant in Khartoum, Sudan. This attack was in retaliation for the August 7 bombings of US embassies in Tanzania and Keyna. The Sudanese protested the attack, and subsequent investigation cast doubt on the assertion that this was a chemical weapons plant."
4218,"This dispute consists of 2 incidents in which North Korea warned that if American or South Korean vessels go beyond designated lanes and waterways in the Yellow Sea it will be regarded as an intrusion into North Korean waters and would be subject to military retaliation. The dispute centers around the September 1999 declaration of a new military demarcation in the Yellow Sea, declaring the Northern Limit Line established after the Korean War invalid. South Korea has ignored the declaration and US-led United Nations takes the position that the NLL has been recognized and maintained as the de factor maritime border for 35 years."
4219,"The border between Venezuela and Colombia was unsettled, and relations along the border were compounded by Colombia’s long struggle against various guerrilla movements; this struggle occasionally spilled over the Venezuelan border, and created a great deal of tension among Venezuelans living near the border. A Venezuelan helicopter violated the border and landed in Arauca, Colombia on January 7, 1994. Venezuelan soldiers kidnapped seven Colombian fishermen. After the overloaded helicopter crashed five of the seven kidnapped fishermen were either released or escaped. A second Venezuelan helicopter that came to rescue machine-gunned the wreckage to make it appear to be downed by Colombian guerrillas. It is not clear whether the Venezuelan forces mistook the Colombian fishermen for guerrillas, or whether this action was intended to support Venezuela’s territorial claim along the border. A Venezuelan general later apologized for the incident on Colombian television. The final two fishermen were released on September 1st. There is no information on any negotiations that may have taken place."
4220,"On two separate occasions (10/17/2000 and 10/19/2000) two Russian jets fly over the USS Kitty Hawk on its way to, and then from, exercises in the Korean Straits. Both times the Russian jets were chased by American F-18s."
4221,"A Russian guard was killed by Turkish border guards apparently after being lured toward the Turkish troops. Three months later, Turkish troops entered Armenian territory, finding Russian guards patrolling the Armenian border, who demanded the Turkish troops stop. Russian forces subsequently went on alert."
4222,"A Russian coast guard vessel fired at, and subsequently seized a Japanese fishing trawler on April 21, 2000 in the region of the disputed southern Kurile islands. The Japanese authorities indicated that the Japanese fishermen had never left the 200-mile Japanese economic zone. However, the Russian officials legitimized the firing and seizure of the Russian coast guards, saying that the Japanese vessel disobeyed orders from a Russian patrol boat to stop for inspection. According to them, the Japanese vessel entered the Russian economic zone and was seized by the Russian border guards while it was escaping from the Russian economic zone into the neutral waters."
4223,"This dispute comprises 13 incidents. Eight incidents involved clashes between Indian and Pakistani troops in the disputed territory of Kashmir. Three incidents involved the disputed territory of the Rann of Kutch: the first of these occurred when Indian aircraft shot down a Pakistani military aircraft in Indian airspace over the Rann of Kutch; subsequently, Pakistani troops occupied the territory at the site of the wreckage and directed groundfire at Indian aircraft; the third incident involved Pakistani border fortifications in the Rann. The remaining two incidents involved military alerts by India and Pakistan. The Indian alert followed the military coup in Pakistan removing Nawaz Sharif and installing Pervez Musharrif. The Pakistani alert followed an announcement of Indian military exercises to be conducted near the Pakistani border."
4224,Turkey threatened to intervene in the Balkan civil war against Yugoslavia if the conflict spread to Macedonia.
4225,"This dispute consists of three incidents in which North Korean spy vessels entered Japanese waters. In response, Japanese vessels chased the vessels for 24 hours. During the chase Japanese planes dropped bombs and Japanese naval vessels fired warning shots. In addition, Japan scrambled 2 F-15s to the area. In response, North Korea scrambled 4 fighters to the area."
4226,This dispute consists of one incident in which North Korea deployed ballistic missiles on mobile launchers that were capable of hitting Tokyo. Reports indicated that the missile deployment was a North Korean attempt to improve their bargaining position in normalization talks with Japan.

4236,Azerbaijan threatens to go to war if Armenia does not give up its territory in Nagorno-Karabahk.
4237,Lesotho reinforces its border by deploying troops to maintain security. Lesotho accuses South African farmers of stealing cattle in Lesotho with the help of South African army members. South Africa denies any involvement.
4238,Russian planes were violating Norwegian airspace. Norway puts its planes in the air to intercept the Russians. Russia claims to have done nothing wrong. Then on 2/19/2001 Norway held military exercises close to its border with Russia.
4239,Russian bombers violated Japanese airspace. Japan sent fighters to intercept the Russian planes.

4242,Georgia claims that Russia had violated their airspace. Russia denies this claim.
4243,This dispute is based on Palau's attack on Philippines by its assault on a Philippine vessel allegedly poaching in Palau waters.
4244,Angolan troops were sent to the Democratic Republic of Congo border as part of an ongoing civil conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Angola supports rebel troops in the Democratic Republic of Congo and may have sent forces to the border to help cut supply lines to the capitol (Kinshasa).
4245,"This dispute is a result of spill-over fighting between government and rebel forces in both states. Shells fired from Congo (although it is not clear by whom) hit Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Democratic Republic of Congo retaliated."
4246,"Angola intervened in the Congolese civil war on behalf of rebel forces. Angola and the rebel forces took control of the capitol on 10/15/97, effectively ending the civil war and this MID."
4248,"This dispute involves border insecurity on both sides due to the presence of rebel forces operating in the area. On September 28, 1998 Sudan called for a general mobilization against Uganda. Then on October 3, a Sudanese Antonov bomber dropped 9 bombs on two towns in northwestern Uganda, and on the 3rd of November, Sudan fortified its border with Uganda. As a result of the Sudanese buildup on the border Uganda put its troops on alert. Then in April of 1999, Uganda fortified its border with Sudan."
4249,Kenya fortified its border with Uganda without specific reasons given. There has been tension in the border region before.
4250,"Cameroun claims part of Nigerian territory--specifically the oil-rich Bakassi peninsula area. The dispute was submitted to the ICI, but clashes continue in the region, and both states regularly reinforce positions along the border."
4251,"Nigeria intervenes on behalf of Sierra Leone's ousted government (removed from power on 5/25/97 by rebel forces), occupying and fighting in Sierra Leone for almost one year. The dispute ends after Nigeria successfully removes rebel government and restores power to ousted regime. Nigeria operated under the auspices of ECOWAS; but, with the exception of minimal support from Ghana and Guinea, Nigeria was basically operating unilaterally."
4252,"Uganda and Rwanda were allies in the Democratic Republic of Congo war. When the rebel groups they supported split into factions, they chose to support opposite sides. This dispute began when Uganda landed troops in Kisangani and a clash with Rwandan troops ensued."
4253,"Rwanda and Uganda were allies in the Democratic Republic of Congo war, but ended up supporting opposing rebel groups inside the Democratic Republic of Congo. In this dispute they battle for control of Kisangani."
4254,The U.S. ordered the vessel Chinook to the waters off the Liberian coast after the U.S. embassy was caught in crossfire during a fight between rebel and govt. forces. Liberia protested this action as a violation of its territorial integrity.
4255,"Nigeria entered Liberian territory to arrest Sierra Leonean officials. Sierra Leone did not protest the arrest. Liberia protested the border violation, resulting in this MID."
4256,"Nigeria and Sierra Leone threatened to use force against Liberia if it continued supplying arms to Sierra Leonean rebels. In response, Liberia sent troops to its border."
4257,Both states have problems with dissident groups attacking from one another's border. Liberia reinforces and closes its border with guinea. Guinea launches several cross border attacks.
4258,"In May 1998, border skirmishes between Ethiopia and Eritrea spun into the world's largest conventional war at the time. The war displaced hundreds of thousands of residents and claimed several thousands causalities. From the outset, U.S. diplomats worked through the Organization of African Unity to bring a peaceful end to the war. In June 2000, Ethiopia and Eritrea signed a cease-fire, December 12, 2000 they signed a permanent peace treaty. The treaty established a process for the demarcation of the border between the countries, working through old colonial documents to establish the boundary. More than 4,000 U.N. peacekeepers have been assigned to help keep the peace. The treaty calls for the return of troops on both sides to positions prior to the conflict. This is particularly critical in light of Spring 2000 offensive, during which Ethiopian troops ranged far into Eritrea's territory. The treaty also sets up a process for settling claims and compensation for damaged property on both sides."
4259,"Nicaragua and Honduras had been experiencing tensions since Honduras’ November 1999 ratification of a 1986 treaty with Colombia covering maritime delimitation in the Caribbean Sea. Nicaragua objected because this treaty gave away waters that were also claimed by Nicaragua, and demanded that the treaty be rejected. This led to a series of militarized incidents, and Nicaragua submitted the case to the International Court of Justice in December 1999. In February 2001, Nicaragua expressed concern over Honduran troop deployments on their common border. They claimed that the number of Honduran border posts increased from six to 21 and the number of soldiers deployed on the border increased from thirty to 300. Nicaragua also claimed that Honduras was upgrading its F-5 fighters and constantly recruiting more troops in the states bordering Nicaragua. Concerned that Honduras was preparing to take over the Nicaraguan city of Somotillo, the Nicaraguan government asked the Organization of American States to monitor the border. In March, Nicaragua also claimed Honduras was conducting military maneuvers near its borders without advance notice; Honduras rejected this allegation. Honduras claimed its forces were in the area to take over reconstruction tasks after hurricane Mitch’s destruction in 1998. They invited Nicaraguan officials to the border to evaluate the situation. Nicaragua rejected a Honduran invitation to demarcate their border. On March 13, Honduras welcomed an OAS mission to verify that they did not send troops to the border with belligerent intent. On March 16th, Nicaragua and Honduras signed an agreement with the OAS help to ease the tension. The agreement required two countries to conduct at least four combined patrols per year in the Caribbean Sea; freeze the number of troops on their border; exchange information on their military positions; conduct parallel border patrols; and inform the OAS about arms imports and exports."
4260,"Late in September 1999, the Venezuelan government dismissed the border agreement they had with Guyana and protested oil exploration concessions awarded by Guyana in the Esequibo region of their disputed maritime border. Later, on October 3, 1999 Venezuela moved its troops close to their border with Guyana. When Guyana protested these Venezuelan moves along the border, Venezuelan officials claimed that the troop buildups were linked to drug trafficking exercises, not intimidation tactics. They announced that they would never attempt to achieve their goals through the use of violence. Two days later, two Venezuelan helicopters crossed the border near a military post near Etetringbang, northwest Guyana. As a result of increasing tensions on their disputed border, on October 6, 1999, the Guyanese government put its army on full alert. Despite Venezuelan announcements that they would never use force, Venezuela maintained its claim on Guyanese territory, and there were no settlements."
4261,"In mid-October, 2000, the United States Coast Guard boat Gendian was accused by the Venezuelan government by violating their territorial waters at the mouth of Orinoco River. On October 21, the United States Coast Guard boat Reliance was intercepted by a Venezuelan patrol boat, Patria. Reliance left the area after four Venezuelan airplanes came to the scene. Claiming that this was the second time in less than a month that such a violation of territorial waters took place, the Venezuelan government issued a formal protest to the United States government. In their reply to the Venezuelan protest, United States officials claimed that the incident took place in international waters and that Venezuela used disproportionate military power."
4262,"Following a long series of drug-related problems on their border, Venezuelan forces mounted a nine-hour operation across the border on October 13, 2000. Venezuelan soldiers, supported by two helicopters and one airplane, bombarded and set fire to houses, destroyed coca plantations, and killed an undetermined number of farm animals. While Colombia claimed that the incident took place during a drug operation, Venezuela denied that it took place. Tibu, the village in question, is located 285 miles northeast of Bogota. Colombia sent troops to the site of the incident. In an apparently unrelated incident on November 15, Venezuelan National Guard forces, transported by two helicopters and supported by other aircraft, crossed the border to Colombia. The Venezuelans arrested four Colombian farm workers, taking them to Venezuela. Venezuelan officials admitted the incident took place, but promised to investigate and punish the people responsible for it. About a week later, on November 23, 2000, during clashes between Colombian military and rebels near the border with Venezuela, at least six Venezuelan helicopters crossed the border. The “war of words” between Colombia and Venezuela continued until late December 2000, when tensions started to decrease as a result of conciliatory meetings."
4263,"In 1999, after Honduras and Colombia signed a treaty that dismissed Nicaragua’s claim to 52,000 square miles of the Caribbean Sea, Nicaragua filed a lawsuit with regional and world courts. When Honduras countersued at the regional court, Nicaragua imposed a 35 percent duty on imports from Honduras. These moves led to a number of incidents in the Caribbean involving Nicaragua and either Colombia or Honduras. In one of those incidents, the maritime border between Nicaragua and Colombia witnessed a new incident sometime in late October or early November 2001. Colombian navy boarded the Nicaraguan fishing boat “Danny Junior” and arrested 11 Nicaraguan fishermen, claiming that they had entered Colombian territorial waters. The arrested fishermen were taken to San Andres Island and a fine of $8,000 was demanded for their release. Nicaraguan officials sent a “firm note of protest” to Colombia and claimed that the incident took place in their own territorial waters."
4264,"This dispute is related to peace-keeping operations in East Timor. The Australian- led Interfet force sent to East Timor in September 1999 faced ""aggressive probing"" from Indonesian aircraft and submarines. Consequently, Australian-led warships and combat jets were on strip alert for the first two weeks of the East Timor military operation."
4265,"This dispute is related to the peace-keeping process in East Timor. An Indonesian soldier was shot dead in a gun battle with New Zealand troops, while the UN peace-keepers were boosting security along the border with Indonesia. It is understood from the reports that the shot Indonesian soldier was from the group against the independence of East Timor. He was out of uniform and fired at least two shots at the peace-keepers from the Indonesian side of the unmarked border, and was shot four times consequently."
4266,"This dispute consists of 1 incident in which Japanese patrol boats exchanged fire with a North Korean spy ship. The dispute began when a Japanese patrol plane spotted the ship 90 miles NW of Amami-O-Shima Island. Japanese patrol boats approached the vessel, ordering it to stop and firing warning shots at the vessel. Japanese forces tried to board the vessel but were fended off with pipes. Japanese forces then pursued the North Korean vessel westward, surrounding the vessel 240 miles off Amami-O-shima. According to reports, the North Korean vessel fired rockets at the Japanese patrol boats, missing them. The Japanese and North Korean forces also exchanged automatic weapon fire. The North Korean vessel sank following the exchange, most likely due to an explosion the North Koreans attempted to set. In total, 3 Japanese crew members were injured, 3 North Koreans were killed, and 12 North Koreans were missing. North Korea is coded as the revisionist state because its actions are challenging Japanese territorial integrity. The Japanese actions are only in response to those of North Korea and are only designed to return to the status quo."
4269,"As was the case on several occasions after the end of the Gulf War, Iraq sent troops and/or took other hostile actions directed at Kuwait. During this dispute, sources say Iraq moved 50,000 or more troops close to the Kuwaiti border. Iraqi actions provoked a number of responses from members of the Gulf War coalition both to reinforce the border, and to signal Iraq that its action would not be tolerated. Coder: Ric Stoll. Date: 8/2/02."
4270,"The United States Navy boarded two Iraqi boats in the Persian Gulf. The Iraqi boats, suspected of trying to violate UN-imposed trade embargos, refused to be boarded and Navy commandos and Marines took the boats by force. After it was determined that the boats were not operating in violation of any UN sanctions they were released."
4271,"The dispute began when Iraq amassed 30,000 to 40,000 troops a few miles south of Erbil, a village outside the Kurdish zone in northern Iraq. The Iraqi troops appeared to be supported by artillery, surface-to-air missiles, and other armored vehicles. Iraq moved into the northern flight exclusion zone in order to aid their Kurdish allies in attacking a rival Kurdish faction. The United States responded by putting its forces in the region on a heightened state of readiness. A few days later, Kuwait put its forces on alert, fearing an Iraqi attack. The United States launched several attacks on Iraqi military sites in the southern no-flight zone and increased its presence in the region. Over the following weeks, the United States and Iraq engaged in frequent clashes in the flight exclusion zones, while American planes patrolled these areas. On one occasion, British planes, which routinely participated in patrolling the flight exclusion zones, were involved with American planes in an attack on an Iraqi anti-aircraft battery. Iraq slowly withdrew its forces from the northern flight exclusion zone, largely in response to American pressure. Consequently, the dispute outcome was coded as a yield by Iraq. And, there were no formal or informal efforts to end the dispute."
4272,"On a number of occasions since the end of the Gulf War, Iraq and Kuwait were involved in MIDs relating to the border (either land or territorial waters – a maritime DMZ was created after the Gulf War) between the countries (MIDS 268, 269, 272, 274, 275). Border problems arise because the UN adjusted the border after the Gulf War and the border areas may contain oil. This MID is primarily concerned with the DMZ that exists between the territorial waters of Iraq and Kuwait. Most of the incidents involve firing between Iraq and Kuwait vessels in waters that are disputed. At least one source characterizes the boundaries of the maritime DMZ as “ambiguous.” Coder: Ric Stoll. Date: 7/24/02."
4273,"The dispute began (10/7/1997) because of increasing intransigence by Iraq. Iraq increased the frequency with which it violated the no-fly zones and threatened to refuse to allow Americans on the UN inspections team. Most importantly, Iraq threatened to shoot down an American U-2 spy plane. The United States and the United Kingdom responded by threatening military action if Iraq attempted to shoot down an American plane. Kuwait responded to the heightened tension between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Iraq by putting its troops on alert. On 11/13/1997, Iraq carried out its threat to expel US Arms inspectors. The United States and the United Kingdom began preparing for punitive air strikes against Iraq if Iraq did not begin to cooperate with UN weapons inspectors. On 11/23/1997, Iraq allowed weapons inspectors to reenter, but it continued to hamper UN investigations, restricting access to selected sites. On 1/17/1998, Iraq again threatened to expel weapons inspectors, requesting that economic sanctions against it be lifted. The United States reiterated its threat to use force if Iraq did not allow UN inspectors unrestricted access to all suspected sites. The US and UK military buildup in the region continued and they announced that their forces were combat ready (2/7/1998). In mid November, the United States reissued its threat to use force against Iraq if it did not unconditionally comply with UN weapons inspectors. All remaining weapons inspectors withdrew in response to the United States’ warning. Iraq capitulated on 11/15/1998, promising to comply with the UN inspection teams. The United States and the United Kingdom stated that if Iraq did not continue to comply, they would use force against it. On 12/10, Iraq ended cooperation with UN inspectors. The United States and the United Kingdom announced that they would attack Iraq without warning for breaking it promise of full cooperation. On 11/16, they began “Operation Desert Fox,” a four- day bombing campaign against Iraq. Israel also put its military on alert, fearing that Iraq would attack it in retaliation for U.S. and British military actions against Iraq. Almost immediately after the American and British bombing campaign, Iraq stated that it would challenge the no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq (11/1998; 1/3/1999). There were clashes on almost a daily basis between British and American planes patrolling the northern and southern no-fly zones and Iraqi military installations from December 1998 to October 2001. Although clashes between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Iraq occurred almost continuously until October, Iraqi challenges to the no-fly zones escalated in August 2001 and were more frequent until mid-October. On 2/15/1999, Iraq threatened to attack Turkey if it continued to allow American planes to use its bases. On 2/2/1999, the United States and the United Kingdom announced that they would retaliate if fired upon, by bombing pre-determined targets in Iraq that were deemed threatening. The United States and the United Kingdom engaged in numerous retaliatory bombing campaigns on Iraqi targets through October (2001), as Iraq continued to threaten and fire upon American and British planes patrolling the no-fly zones. On 10/22/1999, 11 nations (USA, UK, Egypt, United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Jordan, France, Italy, Netherlands, Greece, and Germany) participated in joint military exercises to demonstrate that an anti-Iraq coalition could still be formed. On 5/23/2001 and 8/24/2001, an Iraqi patrol crossed into Saudi territory and fired on a Saudi border patrol. Iraq acted in order to demonstrate its disapproval of Saudi aid to the United States. On 6/11/2001, Saudi Arabia seized a unused pipeline from Iraq in retaliation for Iraqi violations of Saudi borders."
4274,"On a number of occasions since the end of the Gulf War, Iraq and Kuwait were involved in MIDs relating to the border (either land or territorial waters – a maritime DMZ was created after the Gulf War) between the countries (MIDS 268, 269, 272, 274, 275). Border problems arise because the UN adjusted the border after the Gulf War and the border areas may contain oil. In this dispute, Iraq moved a large number of troops to the Kuwaiti border, but there were no other incidents. Coder: Ric Stoll. Date: 7/24/02."
4275,"Saddam Hussein made a speech that Kuwait viewed as a threat. Over several days, Iraqi newspapers (controlled by the government) published articles that were viewed as threatening Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (calling them “traitors” for allowing USA and UK to launch no-fly zone patrols from their territory, saying “If the treacherous leaders in Kuwait need another lesson, we are more than ready to hand one out to them”). In response, Kuwait met with a number of foreign ambassadors, and increased the readiness of its military. In later newspaper articles, Iraq said that it had not issued threats to anyone."
4277,"This dispute is related to the conflict between India and Pakistan beginning in 1947 over control of the disputed territory of Kashmir. Preceded by general low level violence along the Kashmiri border, an attack on the Indian Parliament in Delhi by Islamic terrorists occurs in July 2001. India accuses Pakistan of harboring the terrorist organizations and initiates a full mobilization of its military forces and moves those forces to the Indian/Pakistani border. Pakistan responds with its own military mobilization and heavy fighting breaks out along the border. The fighting subsides following visits to both countries by Richard Armitage (Dep. Asst. Sec. of State) and Donald Rumsfeld (Sec. of Defense) in June 2002."
4278,"This dispute consists of 1 incident in which 3 Australian naval vessels traversed into a ""sensitive"" area of the Taiwan Strait and defied an order to leave the area by a Chinese warship. According to reports, the 3 Australian vessels entered the Taiwan Strait as they were returning from a visit to South Korea. In response, a Chinese warship intercepted the vessels. The Australian vessels sailed on after telling the Chinese vessel that it was within their right to do so. China protested the action."
4279,"This dispute is based on a show of force by China against Philippines. China is reported to have increased its naval presence in the disputed Spratly Islands in May 2001, including conducting live fire exercises in the area. Furthermore, Chinese vessels were spotted in the Scarsborough Shoal area for the first time. This naval deployment occurred even though China assured to Philippines that China was not seeking a military presence in the area."
4280,"This dispute involves 5 incidents between the US & China that center around American reconnaissance near the Chinese coast. On 4/1/2001 an American spy plane crash-landed on China's Hainan Island after colliding with a Chinese fighter over international waters. The Chinese pilot was killed in the accidental collision. China, after the crash, seized both the American crew and plane. The United States responded to the crash and seizure by demanding release of the crew and return of the plane. The US also responded by moving 3 destroyers to the waters off China. China scrambled 10 fighters on 4/5/01 when it detected a US spy plane off the China coast. The dispute was resolved on 7/3/01 after the US expressed regret and the plane was returned to the US. The crew was released on 4/11/01."
4281,"This dispute consists of 6 incidents in which Chinese threats toward Taiwan escalated to involve shows of force by both sides. The issue under dispute involves Chinese concern over Taiwanese moves toward independence. Because Chinese actions are aimed at changing Taiwanese behavior, China is coded as the revisionist state. The dispute began on 3/27/01 when China threatened to declare war if Taiwan declared independence. On 8/1/01 China again threatened to use force if Taiwan declared independence. These threats were followed by a Taiwanese show of force in which Taiwan conducted aerial flight maneuvers with 10 AH-1W Helicopters on 8/21/012. On 8/22/01 china conducted the largest exercises ever around Dongshan Island. According to reports, the exercises involved 100,000 personnel and simulated how the PLA would ""smash"" separatist actions by Taiwan. The US responded to the Chinese moves by threatening force if Taiwan was attacked. The US also conducted naval exercises in the South China Sea as a show of force. The naval exercise only lasted one day (8/17/01) and involved two U.S. aircraft carriers. China is coded as the revisionist state because its actions are aimed at altering Taiwanese policy toward independence."
4282,"This militarized dispute consists of four incidents in which North Korean and South Korean forces squabbled over their border. The dispute began on 6/2/2001 when three North Korean cargo vessels crossed the Northern Limit Line, returning to international waters when they were challenged by South Korean naval vessels. A second North Korean incursion occurred on 9/26/2001 when North Korean forces accidentally encroached across the DMZ on two separate occasions. In response, South Korean border forces fired warning shots. On 11/18/2001 another North Korean border violation occurred when a North Korean patrol boat violated the Northern Limit Line and remained in South Korean waters for 36 minutes before being driven out. On 11/27/2001 North and South Korean forces along the DMZ exchanged fire. There were no injuries or fatalities from the exchange of fire, only minor damage. North Korea is coded as the revisionist state in this dispute because their actions are challenging the post Korean War status quo. In this dispute, North Korea challenges both the Northern Limit Line and the DMZ that were established following the Korean war."
4283,"This dispute consists of a series of 35militarized incidents that are centered around the response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist strikes against the United States. In response to the terrorist attacks, the United States demanded that Afghanistan turn over Osama bin Laden and expel Al Qaeda members that were operating and training in Afghanistan. 9/15/01 – the United States, Great Britain, and France deployed naval forces to waters near Afghanistan. The United States deployed 2 aircraft carriers, Great Britain deployed 6 warships, and France deployed 2 warships. In response to the American deployment, Afghanistan placed its forces on alert and deployed anti-aircraft weapons around Kandahar. Russia, which had experienced previous disputes with Afghanistan along the Tajik border, placed its forces along the Tajik border on alert and mass weapons and troops along the border in response to the rising tensions in the region. 9/17/01 – American president Bush issued an ultimatum to the Afghan leadership to turn over Osama bin Laden or face American military strikes. The Taliban refused to turn over bin Laden unless a series of unreasonable conditions were met (trial by Muslim judge, recognition for the Taliban, foreign aid for Afghanistan, etc.) 9/22/01 – An American reconnaissance drone is shot down over Afghanistan. During this time, Great Britain began deploying special forces to Afghanistan 9/25/01 – British prime minister Tony Blair issued an ultimatum to the Afghan leaders to face military action if they do not turnover Osama bin Laden and shutdown the terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. 9/30/01 – The United States continued to increase the pressure on the Taliban by continuing to deploy forces to the region. In addition to the naval forces already deployed, the United States also sent ground forces to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan and sent the USS Kitty Hawk carrier group to the region. The Taliban responded to the increasing American pressure by conducting exercises along its border with Pakistan. During this period of time Taliban forces also fired on a Russian border post along the Tajik- Afghan border. Russian forces suffered no casualties in the clash and returned fire at the Taliban forces. No information was given regarding Afghan casualties. Early October, 2001 – The British government issued a series of statements threatening military action against Afghanistan if the Taliban did not turn over Osama bin Laden. 10/6/01 – Afghanistan threatened war against Uzbekistan if the United States launched attacks from Uzbekistan. Afghanistan also began redeploying forces to its border with Uzbekistan. In response, Uzbekistan began deploying its forces along the border with Afghanistan. Reports also indicate that Afghanistan fired at an unmanned American drone conducting reconnaissance. As conditions deteriorated, Tajikistan placed its forces along the border on alert. 10/7/01 – American and British strikes on Afghanistan began. The first strikes involved attacks from cruise missiles, bombers, and missiles and initial targets were confined to airfields, command and control centers, military installations. 10/9/01 – NATO redeploys its naval forces to the eastern Mediterranean in response to the conflict in Afghanistan. Ships from Greece, Germany, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Great Britain, and the United States participate in the redeployment. 10/10/01 – Following three days of sustained attacks, bombing targets began to include strikes against troops. Near this time, American and British forces began bombing Taliban forces positioned north of Kabul. These strikes involved the use of heavy cluster bombs and were likely to inflict heavy casualties on Taliban forces. These bombing strikes continued on a daily basis into November 10/16/01 – A Taliban gunman fired at a border picket occupied by Russian troops along the Tajik border. There were no Russian casualties in the attack. 10/17/01 – Reports indicate that Australian troops are now on the ground in Afghanistan conducted ground operations against Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces. 10/19/01-11/13/01 – US commando units began conducting ground operations within Afghan territory. These ground raids were used to attack Taliban and Al-Qaeda forces, flush them out for airstrikes, and for intelligence purposes. Two American soldiers were killed when their search and rescue helicopter crashed in Pakistan after a mission. These deaths are not counted in the dispute coding because they were accidental and did not result from military action. Allied airstrikes continue throughout this period. 11/13/01 – Russia “took additional security measures” along its border with Afghanistan. Taliban forces withdraw from Kabul and Northern Alliance troops take the capital. Because the Taliban has lost control of the capital, the dispute ends."

The Egyptian military attaché in Khartoum had been summoned to the Armed Forces Command to hear a protest against ""large scale movement and intense activity by Egyptian forces"" in the region. Mubarak refused to confirm reports of Egyptian military moves on the border with Sudan. He reiterated accusations that Sudan was harbouring terrorists who participated in last June's attempt to assassinate him in Ethiopia. Egypt also claims ownership to Halaib and offshore areas in the red sea under an 1899 agreement that set the frontier along the 22nd parallel. It has said Egypt gave Sudan administrative powers in Halaib in 1902 because Sudanese tribes inhabited the triangular enclave. Sudan contends the Egyptian claim and says it has ""full sovereignty"" over the Halaib area."

One Syrian source called this operation (which was reported to involve up to 50,000 troops, and hundreds of tanks and aircraft) “an invasion;” the Syrian deployment was a direct response to the Turkish action. But there are two other issues that cloud relations between these two countries. First, Turkeiy has pursued closer relations with Israel.
